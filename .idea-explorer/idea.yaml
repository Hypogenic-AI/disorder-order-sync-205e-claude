idea:
  title: 'When Disorder Creates Order: Unexpected Synchronization in Heterogeneous
    Networks'
  domain: mathematics
  hypothesis: "Contrary to traditional expectations, there exist network topologies\
    \ and parameter distributions where disorder\u2014judiciously imposed\u2014broadens\
    \ or stabilizes the region of synchronization, subject to the barycentric condition\
    \ discussed by Palacios, In, and Amani (2024).\n"
  background:
    description: 'Sometimes, adding chaos to a system can make it more organized!
      Let''s experimentally test how deliberately introducing disorder to network
      parameters sometimes improves synchronization, defying expectations from classical
      homogeneous network theory.
