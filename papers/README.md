6. **Asymmetry Underlies Stability in Power Grids** (2103.10952)
   - Authors: Molnar, Nishikawa, Motter
   - Year: 2021
   - File: `2103.10952_molnar_asymmetry_power.pdf`
   - Why relevant: Extends CSB/AISync results to power grid models (swing equations), showing practical relevance of disorder-enhanced synchronization.

7. **Network Synchronization Landscape Reveals Compensatory Structures** (0909.2874)
   - Authors: Nishikawa, Motter
   - Year: 2010
   - File: `0909.2874_nishikawa_motter_landscape.pdf`
   - Why relevant: Identifies compensatory network structures where mixed interactions enhance synchronization; shows quantization in optimal synchronizability.

8. **Synchronization is Optimal in Nondiagonalizable Networks** (cond-mat/0605619)
   - Authors: Nishikawa, Motter
   - Year: 2006
   - File: `cond-mat_0605619_nishikawa_optimal.pdf`
   - Why relevant: Shows that optimal synchronization requires asymmetric (nondiagonalizable) network structures, precursor to the AISync concept.
