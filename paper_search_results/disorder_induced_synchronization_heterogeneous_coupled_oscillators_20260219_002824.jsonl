It is generally believed that homogeneity among the entities is beneficial for synchronization. This work shows theoretically, numerically, and experimentally that the opposite is not only possible but also common in systems with interaction delays. In such systems, heterogeneity among the entities is shown to promote synchronization, even when the heterogeneity is completely random. This finding advances our understanding of the interplay between order and disorder in the collective behavior of complex systems. We suggest that the phenomenon can be observed for diverse coupling schemes and has implications for real-world systems, where heterogeneity and delays are common and often unavoidable. A widely held assumption on network dynamics is that similar components are more likely to exhibit similar behavior than dissimilar ones and that generic differences among them are necessarily detrimental to synchronization. Here, we show that this assumption does not generally hold in oscillator networks when communication delays are present. We demonstrate, in particular, that random parameter heterogeneity among oscillators can consistently rescue the system from losing synchrony. This finding is supported by electrochemical-oscillator experiments performed on a multielectrode array network. Remarkably, at intermediate levels of heterogeneity, random mismatches are more effective in promoting synchronization than parameter assignments specifically designed to facilitate identical synchronization. Our results suggest that, rather than being eliminated or ignored, intrinsic disorder in technological and biological systems can be harnessed to help maintain coherence required for function.", "citations": 43}

Under fixed frequency disorder, we investigate homogeneous fully coupled external-cavity semiconductor lasers governed by the complex, time-delayed Lang-Kobayashi equations with experimentally relevant parameters and identify an optimal coupling strength that maximizes steady-state synchronization in the weak-coupling regime, which we term disorder-mediated synchronization resonance. This optimum appears for any fixed configuration of intrinsic frequency detuning and scales inversely with the number of lasers, leading to a linear scaling of the total coupling cost with the number of lasers. A theory based on an effective thermodynamic potential explains this disorder-mediated optimization, revealing a general mechanism by which moderate coupling can overcome static heterogeneity in nonlinear physical systems.", "citations": 1}

However, its constructive role in stabilizing nontrivial cooperative patterns remains largely unexplored. In this Letter, we show that frequency heterogeneity among oscillators can induce stable cyclops and cluster states in Kuramoto networks with higher-mode coupling, even though these states are unstable in the identical oscillator case. Cyclops states, introduced in [Munyaev et\u00a0al., Phys. Rev.

Surprisingly, heterogeneity alone is sufficient to stabilize these patterns across a sizable range of detuning values without needing to be compensated by other forms of disorder or external tuning. To explain this effect, we introduce a mesoscopic collective coordinate approach that links microscopic frequency structure with mean-field cluster-level stability. Importantly, we demonstrate that the same disorder-induced stabilization mechanism also arises robustly in biologically and physically grounded networks of Winfree and Stuart-Landau oscillators, pointing to its generality and opening directions for designing multistate dynamics in heterogeneous networks.", "citations": 0}

The results are demonstrated experimentally using networks of Chua's oscillators and are further supported by numerical simulations and theoretical analysis.

The bimodal distributions for the coupling strengths and frequencies are either correlated or uncorrelated. To study how correlation affects phase coherence, we analyzed the TFTC model by means of numerical simulations and exact dimensional reduction methods allowing to study the collective dynamics in terms of local order parameters [S. Watanabe and S. H. Strogatz, Physica D 74(3-4), 197-253 (1994); E. Ott and T. M. Antonsen, Chaos 18(3), 037113 (2008)]. The competition resulting from distributed coupling strengths and natural frequencies produces nontrivial dynamic states. For correlated disorder in frequencies and coupling strengths, we found that the entire oscillator population splits into two subpopulations, both phase-locked (Lock-Lock) or one phase-locked, and the other drifting (Lock-Drift), where the mean-fields of the subpopulations maintain a constant non-zero phase difference. For uncorrelated disorder, we found that the oscillator population may split into four phase-locked subpopulations, forming phase-locked pairs which are either mutually frequency-locked (Stable Lock-Lock-Lock-Lock) or drifting (Breathing Lock-Lock-Lock-Lock), thus resulting in a periodic motion of the global synchronization level. Finally, we found for both types of disorder that a state of Incoherence exists; however, for correlated coupling strengths and frequencies, incoherence is always unstable, whereas it is only neutrally stable for the uncorrelated case. Numerical simulations performed on the model show good agreement with the analytic predictions. The simplicity of the model promises that real-world systems can be found which display the dynamics induced by correlated/uncorrelated disorder.", "citations": 5}

Previous studies extensively investigate noise-induced synchrony in coupled neural oscillators, with a focus on scenarios featuring uniform noise and equal coupling strengths between neurons. However, real-world or experimental settings frequently exhibit heterogeneity, including deviations from uniformity in coupling and noise patterns. This study investigates noise-induced synchrony in a pair of coupled excitable neurons operating in a heterogeneous environment, where both noise intensity and coupling strength can vary independently. Each neuron is an excitable oscillator, represented by the normal form of Hopf bifurcation (HB). In the absence of stimulus, these neurons remain quiescent but can be triggered by perturbations, such as noise. Typically, noise and coupling exert opposing influences on neural dynamics, with noise diminishing coherence and coupling promoting synchrony. Our results illustrate the ability of asymmetric noise to induce synchronization in such coupled neural oscillators, with synchronization becoming increasingly pronounced as the system approaches the excitation threshold (i.e., HB). Additionally, we find that uneven coupling strengths and noise asymmetries are factors that can promote in-phase synchrony. Notably, we identify an optimal synchronization state when the absolute difference in coupling strengths is maximized, regardless of the specific coupling strengths chosen. Furthermore, we establish a robust relationship between coupling asymmetry and the noise intensity required to maximize synchronization. Specifically, when one oscillator (receiver neuron) receives a strong input from the other oscillator (source neuron) and the source neuron receives significantly weaker or no input from the receiver neuron, synchrony is maximized when the noise applied to the receiver neuron is much weaker than that applied to the source neuron. These findings reveal the significant connection between uneven coupling and asymmetric noise in coupled neuronal oscillators, shedding light on the enhanced propensity for in-phase synchronization in two-neuron motifs with one-way connections compared to those with two-way connections.

Here, we report on the discovery of the converse of symmetry breaking-the scenario in which complete synchronization is not stable for identically coupled identical oscillators but becomes stable when, and only when, the oscillator parameters are judiciously tuned to nonidentical values, thereby breaking the system symmetry to preserve the state symmetry. Aside from demonstrating that diversity can facilitate and even be required for uniformity and consensus, this suggests a mechanism for convergent forms of pattern formation in which initially asymmetric patterns evolve into symmetric ones.", "citations": 82}

Our approach allows for stabilization of prespecified synchronous states that, while abundant, are often unstable in systems of identical lasers.

Here, we show that uncorrelated noise can in fact enhance synchronization when the oscillators are coupled. Strikingly, our analysis also shows that uncorrelated noise can be more effective than common noise in enhancing synchronization. We first establish these results theoretically for phase and phase-amplitude oscillators subject to either or both additive and multiplicative noise. We then confirm the predictions through experiments on coupled electrochemical oscillators.

Here, we introduce a class of remarkably simple oscillator networks that concurrently exhibit all of these phenomena. The dynamical units consist of pairs of nonidentical phase oscillators, which we refer to as Janus oscillators by analogy with Janus particles and the mythological figure from which their name is derived. In contrast to previous studies, these networks exhibit (i) explosive synchronization with identical oscillators; (ii) extreme multistability of chimera states, including traveling, intermittent, and bouncing chimeras; and (iii) asymmetry-induced synchronization in which synchronization is promoted by random oscillator heterogeneity. These networks also exhibit the previously unobserved possibility of inverted synchronization transitions, in which a transition to a more synchronous state is induced by a reduction rather than an increase in the coupling strength.

Even in the presence of transition rate disorder, numerical and analytical results point to a single phase transition to macroscopic synchrony at a critical value of the coupling strength.

When these two kinds of disorder are uncorrelated (and when the positive and negative couplings are equal in number and strength), it is known that phase coherence cannot occur and synchronization is absent. Here we explore the effects of correlating the disorder. Specifically, we assume that any given oscillator either attracts or repels all the others, and that the sign of the interaction is deterministically correlated with the given oscillator's natural frequency. For symmetrically correlated disorder with zero mean, we find that the system spontaneously synchronizes, once the width of the frequency distribution falls below a critical value. For asymmetrically correlated disorder, the model displays coherent traveling waves: the complex order parameter becomes nonzero and rotates with constant frequency different from the system's mean natural frequency.

It was widely known that the system experiences a continuous (second-order) phase transition to synchronization by gradually increasing the homogeneous coupling among the oscillators. As the interest in exploring synchronized dynamics continues to grow, the heterogeneous patterns between phase oscillators have received ample attention during the past years. Here, we consider a variant of the Kuramoto model with quenched disorder in their natural frequencies and coupling. Correlating these two types of heterogeneity via a generic weighted function, we systematically investigate the impacts of the heterogeneous strategies, the correlation function, and the natural frequency distribution on the emergent dynamics. Importantly, we develop an analytical treatment for capturing the essential dynamical properties of the equilibrium states. In particular, we uncover that the critical threshold corresponding to the onset of synchronization is unaffected by the location of the inhomogeneity, which, however, does depend crucially on the value of the correlation function at its center. Furthermore, we reveal that the relaxation dynamics of the incoherent state featuring the responses to external perturbations is significantly shaped by all the considered effects, thereby leading to various decaying mechanisms of the order parameters in the subcritical region. Moreover, we untangle that synchronization is facilitated by the out-coupling strategy in the supercritical region. Our study is a step forward in highlighting the potential importance of the inhomogeneous patterns involved in the complex systems, and could thus provide theoretical insights for profoundly understanding the generic statistical mechanical properties of the steady states toward synchronization.", "citations": 0}

Here we describe the resulting synchronization dynamics within a mean-field model where the update actions of different oscillators are completely asynchronous. In particular, it is shown how the steady-state level of synchrony depends on noise intensity and frequency diversity for any given rate of updates. The central part of the analysis is devoted to the case when the correction rate positively correlates with the degree of macroscopic coherence. We demonstrate that depending on relation between correction rate and phase coherence the oscillators may exhibit both continuous and discontinuous transition from incoherence to synchrony upon the change of interaction constant.

While the impacts of heterogeneity on synchronization, in terms of structural mismatch of the layers in multiplex networks, has been studied thoroughly, its influence on intralayer synchronization, in terms of parameter mismatch among the layers, has not been adequately investigated. Here, we study the intralayer synchrony in multiplex networks, where the layers are different from one other, due to parameter mismatch in their local dynamics. In such a multiplex network, the intralayer coupling strength for the emergence of intralayer synchronization decreases upon the introduction of impurity among the layers, which is caused by a parameter mismatch in their local dynamics. Furthermore, the area of occurrence of intralayer synchronization also widens with increasing mismatch. We analytically derive a condition under which the intralayer synchronous solution exists, and we even sustain its stability. We also prove that, in spite of the mismatch among the layers, all the layers of the multiplex network synchronize simultaneously.

In this context, we use colored noise to induce synchronization between oscillators with heterogeneity in both phase-response curves and frequencies. In the low noise limit, we derive novel analytical theory showing that the time constant of colored noise influences correlated noise-induced synchronization and that oscillator heterogeneity can limit synchronization.

We also show that introducing the diversity in the intrinsic frequency of the rotary agents makes the fully synchronized state in the SW networks, more fragile than the one in the random networks.", "citations": 0}

Motivated by recent experimental observations, we here uncover an intriguing class of transitions in coupled oscillators, extreme synchronization transitions, from asynchronous disordered states to synchronous states with almost completely ordered phases. Whereas such a transition appears like discontinuous or explosive phase transitions, it exhibits markedly distinct features. First, the transition occurs already in finite systems of N units and so constitutes an intriguing bifurcation of multi-dimensional systems rather than a genuine phase transition that emerges in the thermodynamic limit N \u2192 \u221e only. Second, the synchronization order parameter jumps from moderate values of the order of N\u22121/2 to values extremely close to 1, its theoretical maximum, immediately upon crossing a critical coupling strength. We analytically explain the mechanisms underlying such extreme transitions in coupled complexified Kuramoto oscillators. Extreme transitions may similarly occur across other systems of coupled oscillators as well as in certain percolation processes. In applications, their occurrence impacts our ability of ensuring or preventing strong forms of ordering, for instance in biological and engineered systems. Sudden order-disorder transitions can be seen in the variety of biological and engineered systems.

Our approach is based on the simultaneous block diagonalization of the matrix terms in the variational equation, and it leads to dimension reduction that simplifies the original equation significantly. This new formalism allows the systematic investigation of scenarios in which the oscillators need to be nonidentical in order to reach an identical state, where all oscillators are completely synchronized.

To address this question, we investigate a globally coupled network of Kuramoto-Sakaguchi oscillators that includes both pairwise (1-simplex) and higher-order (2-simplex) interactions, together with additive stochastic forcing. Systematic numerical simulations across a broad range of coupling strengths, phase-lag values, and noise intensities reveal that synchronization emerges through a nontrivial interplay among these parameters. In general, weak frustration combined with mutually reinforcing coupling promotes synchronization, whereas strong frustration favors coherence under repulsive coupling. Forward and backward parameter sweeps reveal the coexistence of synchronized and desynchronized states. The presence and width of this bistable region depend sensitively on phase frustration, noise intensity, and higher-order coupling strength, with higher-order interactions significantly widening the bistable interval. To explain these behaviors, we employ the Ott-Antonsen reduction to derive a low-dimensional amplitude equation that predicts the forward critical point in the thermodynamic limit, the backward saddle-node point, and the width of the bistable region. Higher order interactions widen this region by shifting the saddle-node point without affecting the forward critical point. Further analysis of Kramer's escape rate explains how noise destabilizes coexistence states and diminishes bistability. Overall, our results provide a unified theoretical and numerical framework for frustrated, noisy, higher-order oscillator networks, revealing that synchronization is strongly influenced by the combined action of phase frustration, stochasticity, and both pairwise and higher-order interactions.", "citations": 0}

Despite the presence of misbehaviors, benign oscillators aim to reach synchronization. To achieve this objective, two resilient synchronization protocols are developed in this paper by adapting the real-valued mean-subsequence reduced (MSR) algorithm to pulse-based interactions. The first protocol relies on packet-based communication to transmit absolute frequencies, while the second protocol operates purely with pulses to calculate relative frequencies. In both protocols, each normal oscillator periodically counts the received pulses to detect possible malicious behaviors. By disregarding suspicious pulses from its neighbors, the oscillator updates both its phases and frequencies. The paper establishes sufficient conditions on the initial states and graph structure under which resilient synchronization is achieved in the PCO network. Specifically, the normal oscillators can either detect the presence of malicious nodes or synchronize in both phases and frequencies.

The analysis and the experiment show that disorder leads to a nontrivial stationary state that displays current.

We provide a complete analytical classification of asymptotic behaviors for identical natural frequencies, but heterogeneous inherent amplitudes in the finite-$N$ setting. In the two-oscillator case, we classify the asymptotic behavior in all possible regimes including heterogeneous natural frequencies and inherent amplitudes, and in particular we identify and characterize a novel regime of \\emph{leader-driven synchronization}, wherein one active oscillator can entrain another regardless of frequency mismatch. For general $N$, we prove exponential phase synchronization under sectorial initial data and establish sharp conditions for global amplitude death.

Analyses of two noisy oscillators reveal that nontrivial phase slip is a generic phenomenon when noise is present and coupling is strong.

Explosive percolation, which was discovered in 2009, corresponds to an abrupt change in the network\u2019s structure, and explosive synchronization (which is concerned, instead, with the abrupt emergence of a collective state in the networks\u2019 dynamics) was studied as early as the first models of globally coupled phase oscillators were taken into consideration. The two phenomena have stimulated investigations and debates, attracting attention in many relevant fields. So far, various substantial contributions and progresses (including experimental verifications) have been made, which have provided insights on what structural and dynamical properties are needed for inducing such abrupt transformations, as well as have greatly enhanced our understanding of phase transitions in networked systems.

We explore the effects of heterogeneous coupling phase-lags between the two populations. Such heterogeneity arises naturally in various settings, for example, as an approximation to transmission delays, excitatory-inhibitory interactions, or as amplitude and phase responses of oscillators with electrical or mechanical coupling. We find that breaking the phase-lag symmetry results in a variety of states with uniform and non-uniform synchronization, including in-phase and anti-phase synchrony, full incoherence (splay state), chimera states with phase separation of 0 or \u03c0 between populations, and states where both populations remain desynchronized. These desynchronized states exhibit stable, oscillatory, and even chaotic dynamics. Moreover, we identify the bifurcations through which chimeras emerge. Stable chimera states and desynchronized solutions, which do not arise for homogeneous phase-lag parameters, emerge as a result of competition between synchronized in-phase, anti-phase equilibria, and fully incoherent states when the phase-lags are near \u00b1\u03c02 (cosine coupling).

In many instances, however, the synchronization is undesired because it may lead to system malfunctioning, as in the case of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, for example. Recent studies of static networks of oscillators have shown that the presence of a small fraction of so-called contrarian oscillators can suppress the undesired network synchronization. On the other hand, it is also known that the mobility of the oscillators can significantly impact their synchronization dynamics. Here, we combine these two ideas-the oscillator mobility and the presence of heterogeneous interactions-and study numerically binary mixtures of phase oscillators performing two-dimensional random walks. Within the framework of a generalized Kuramoto model, we introduce two phase-coupling schemes. The first one is invariant when the types of any two oscillators are swapped, while the second model is not. We demonstrate that the symmetric model does not allow for a complete suppression of the synchronized state. However, it provides means for a robust control of the synchronization timescale by varying the overall number density and the composition of the mixture and the strength of the off-diagonal Kuramoto coupling constant. Instead, the asymmetric model predicts that the coherent state can be eliminated within a subpopulation of normal oscillators and evoked within a subpopulation of the contrarians.", "citations": 0}

Colonies of some ant species are able to synchronize their activity to fall into coherent bursts, but models of this phenomenon have neglected the potential effects of intrinsic noise and interspecific differences in individual-level behaviour. We investigated the individual and collective activity patterns of two Leptothorax ant species. We show that in one species (Leptothorax sp. W), ants converge onto rhythmic cycles of synchronized collective activity with a period of about 20 min. A second species (Leptothorax crassipilis) exhibits more complex collective dynamics, where dominant collective cycle periods range from 16 min to 2.8 h. Recordings that last 35 h reveal that, in both species, the same colony can exhibit multiple oscillation frequencies. We observe that workers of both species can be stimulated by nest-mates to become active after a refractory resting period, but the durations of refractory periods differ between the species and can be highly variable. We model the emergence of synchronized rhythms using an agent-based model informed by our empirical data. This simple model successfully generates synchronized group oscillations despite the addition of noise to ants' refractory periods. We also find that adding noise reduces the likelihood that the model will spontaneously switch between distinct collective cycle frequencies.", "citations": 11}

Various dynamical synchronization states (such as oscillation death, phase synchronization, and complete synchronized oscillation) as well as their transitions were explored. In particular, we uncovered a non-traditional quorum sensing transition: increasing the population density leaded to a transition from oscillation death to synchronized oscillation at first, but further increasing the density resulted in degeneration from complete synchronization to phase synchronization or even from phase synchronization to desynchronization. The underlying mechanism of this finding was attributed to the dual roles played by the population density.

A system of coupled oscillators in the synchronous regime may be viewed as a single (higher-dimensional) oscillator. Therefore, we investigate the relation between the Q-functions of the uncoupled oscillators and the higher-dimensional Q-function for the coupled system.

If such a state emerges spontaneously, in other words, if it cannot be associated with any heterogeneity in the system, it is generally referred to as a chimera state. In planar oscillator arrays, these chimera states can take the form of rotating spiral waves surrounding an incoherent core, resembling those observed in oscillatory or excitable media, and may display complex dynamical behavior. To understand this behavior we study stationary and moving chimera states in planar phase oscillator arrays using a combination of direct numerical simulations and numerical continuation of solutions of the corresponding continuum limit, focusing on the existence and properties of traveling spiral wave chimeras as a function of the system parameters. The oscillators are coupled nonlocally and their frequencies are drawn from a Lorentzian distribution. Two cases are discussed in detail, that of a top-hat coupling function and a two-parameter truncated Fourier approximation to this function in Cartesian coordinates. The latter allows semi-analytical progress, including determination of stability properties, leading to a classification of possible behaviors of both static and moving chimera states. The transition from stationary to moving chimeras is shown to be accompanied by the appearance of complex filamentary structures within the incoherent spiral wave core representing secondary coherence regions associated with temporal resonances. As the parameters are varied the number of such filaments may grow, a process reflected in a series of folds in the corresponding bifurcation diagram showing the drift speed s as a function of the phase-lag parameter \u03b1.", "citations": 4}

We use phenomenological model of delay-coupled oscillators with increasing degree of topological complexity to identify underlying principles by which the spatio-temporal structure of the brain governs the phase lags between oscillatory activity at distant regions. Phase relations and their regions of stability are derived and numerically confirmed for two oscillators and for networks with randomly distributed or clustered bimodal delays, as a first approximation for the brain structural connectivity. Besides in-phase, clustered delays can induce anti-phase synchronization for certain frequencies, while the sign of the lags is determined by the natural frequencies and by the inhomogeneous network interactions. For in-phase synchronization faster oscillators always phase lead, while stronger connected nodes lag behind the weaker during frequency depression, which consistently arises for in-silico results. If nodes are in anti-phase regime, then a distance \u03c0 is added to the in-phase trends. The statistics of the phases is calculated from the phase locking values (PLV), as in many empirical studies, and we scrutinize the method\u2019s impact. The choice of surrogates do not affects the mean of the observed phase lags, but higher significance levels that are generated by some surrogates, cause decreased variance and might fail to detect the generally weaker coherence of the interhemispheric links. These links are also affected by the non-stationary and intermittent synchronization, which causes multimodal phase lags that can be misleading if averaged. Taken together, the results describe quantitatively the impact of the spatio-temporal connectivity of the brain to the synchronization patterns between brain regions, and to uncover mechanisms through which the spatio-temporal structure of the brain renders phases to be distributed around 0 and \u03c0.

Unlike the special designs for the coupling terms, this generalized function within the dynamical term reveals another path for generating the first-order phase transitions. The power-law relationship between dynamic characteristics is reasonable, as observed in empirical studies, such as long-term tremor activity during volcanic eruptions and ion channel characteristics of the Xenopus expression system.

In this paper, we draw on an extension of the Kuramoto model, called the Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model, which adds a phase lag parameter to each node. We construct a general formalism that allows us to compute the set of lag parameters that may lead to any phase configuration within a linear approximation. In particular, we devote special attention to the cases of full synchronization and symmetric configurations. We show that the set of natural frequencies, phase lag parameters, and phases at the steady state is coupled by an equation and a continuous spectra of solutions is feasible. In order to quantify the system's strain to achieve that particular configuration, we define a cost function and compute the optimal set of parameters that minimizes it.

Unlike the state-of-the-art synchronization methods, in which a large coupling gain is applied to couple any pair of connected oscillators, the proposed method first casts the whole synchronization process into two phases. The first one considers the period from the beginning to the first instant of synchronization, while the second phase covers the following time in which synchronization must be preserved. It is shown that a large coupling gain is adopted for the first phase, while the averaged coupling gain to preserve the synchronization in the second phase can be reduced significantly by using an offline optimized coupling law. Efficiency and performance of this method are confirmed by a set of numerical tests with different graphs and system dynamics.", "citations": 7}

We find that high levels of synchronization are sustained in the vicinity of the optimal set, allowing for some level of deviation in the frequencies without significant degradation of synchronization.

We introduce an order parameter to quantify the degree of coordination and synchronization, providing insights into how coupling strength, agent diversity, and network topology impact emergent collective behavior. Furthermore, we formalize a detailed correspondence between Chain-of-Thought prompting in AI reasoning and synchronization phenomena, unifying human-like iterative problem solving with emergent group intelligence. Through extensive simulations on all-to-all and deterministic scale-free networks, we demonstrate that increased coupling promotes robust synchronization despite heterogeneous agent capabilities, reflecting realistic collaborative AI scenarios.

Of particular interest is that the optimal collective response emerges near the order-chaos transition point, i.e., at the edge of chaos.

The coupling is achieved by connecting a linear spring between the tip-masses which are in frictional contact with a rigid rotating disc. The Pearson time correlation coefficient is used to measure the strength and mode of synchronization between the oscillations of the coupled system. Periodicity of the motions is determined by evaluating the Poincar\u00e9 map wherein the zero velocity crossing from positive to negative is considered as the Poincar\u00e9 section. The fundamental frequency of the coupled motion and its harmonics are obtained from the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the time responses. A bifurcation study is conducted to identify the periodicity of motion of both the uncoupled and coupled systems. The coupled system is found to be synchronized for the single-periodic, multi-periodic and quasi-periodic motions, but not for chaotic motions. Multiple basins of attractions (BA) of initial conditions corresponding to different synchronization characteristics are observed. The coupled system shows a large dependence of the mass ratio detuning factor (MRDF) on the synchronization characteristics; in-phase synchronization is obtained for smaller MRDF which eventually becomes out-of-phase for larger MRDF. A special study conducted confirms that the coupling can be used to control the amplitude as well as the stick-phase of motion in friction oscillators.", "citations": 4}

Focusing on synchronization as the key task, we theoretically analyze heterogeneous coupled oscillators under both the all-to-all network and complex networks, and derive closed-form expressions for critical attack cost. Numerical simulations show strong agreement with theoretical predictions, validating the proposed framework. Furthermore, we reveal a counterintuitive principle: increased heterogeneity in dynamical parameters-measured by the standard deviation of the Hopf bifurcation parameter-significantly enhances system survivability against attacks. This finding holds across the all-to-all network, Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi random network, and Barab\u00e1si-Albert scale-free network, demonstrating generality beyond specific structures.
