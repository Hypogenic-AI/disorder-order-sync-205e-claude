For specific nongeneric coupling, these tori are equilibria relative to a continuous symmetry action. We analyze how the invariant tori deform under forced symmetry breaking as more general network interaction terms are introduced. We first show in general that perturbed tori that are relative equilibria can be computed using a parametrization method; this yields an asymptotic expansion of an embedding of the perturbed torus, as well as the local dynamics on the torus. We then apply this result to a coupled oscillator network, and we numerically study the dynamics on the persisting tori in the network by looking for bifurcations of their periodic orbits in a boundary-value-problem setup. This way we find new bifurcating stable synchrony patterns that can be the building blocks of larger global structures such as heteroclinic cycles.", "citations": 0}

The ability of the network to adapt coupling strengths between units in accordance with their activity arises naturally in a variety of contexts, including neural plasticity in the brain, and adds an additional layer of complexity: the dynamics on the nodes influence the dynamics of the network and vice versa. We study a minimal model of Kuramoto phase oscillators including a general adaptive learning rule with three parameters (strength of adaptivity, adaptivity offset, adaptivity shift), mimicking learning paradigms based on spike-time-dependent plasticity. Importantly, the strength of adaptivity allows to tune the system away from the limit of the classical Kuramoto model, corresponding to stationary coupling strengths and no adaptation and, thus, to systematically study the impact of adaptivity on the collective dynamics. We carry out a detailed bifurcation analysis for the minimal model consisting of N=2 oscillators. The non-adaptive Kuramoto model exhibits very simple dynamic behavior, drift, or frequency-locking; but once the strength of adaptivity exceeds a critical threshold non-trivial bifurcation structures unravel: A symmetric adaptation rule results in multi-stability and bifurcation scenarios, and an asymmetric adaptation rule generates even more intriguing and rich dynamics, including a period-doubling cascade to chaos as well as oscillations displaying features of both librations and rotations simultaneously. Generally, adaptation improves the synchronizability of the oscillators. Finally, we also numerically investigate a larger system consisting of N=50 oscillators and compare the resulting dynamics with the case of N=2 oscillators.", "citations": 15}

We explore the effects of heterogeneous coupling phase-lags between the two populations. Such heterogeneity arises naturally in various settings, for example, as an approximation to transmission delays, excitatory-inhibitory interactions, or as amplitude and phase responses of oscillators with electrical or mechanical coupling. We find that breaking the phase-lag symmetry results in a variety of states with uniform and non-uniform synchronization, including in-phase and anti-phase synchrony, full incoherence (splay state), chimera states with phase separation of 0 or \u03c0 between populations, and states where both populations remain desynchronized. These desynchronized states exhibit stable, oscillatory, and even chaotic dynamics. Moreover, we identify the bifurcations through which chimeras emerge. Stable chimera states and desynchronized solutions, which do not arise for homogeneous phase-lag parameters, emerge as a result of competition between synchronized in-phase, anti-phase equilibria, and fully incoherent states when the phase-lags are near \u00b1\u03c02 (cosine coupling). These findings elucidate previous experimental results involving a network of mechanical oscillators and provide further insight into the breakdown of synchrony in biological systems.", "citations": 67}

Each of these phenomena has thus far been observed only in systems designed to exhibit that one phenomenon, which raises the questions of whether they are mutually compatible and, if so, under what conditions they co-occur. Here, we introduce a class of remarkably simple oscillator networks that concurrently exhibit all of these phenomena. The dynamical units consist of pairs of nonidentical phase oscillators, which we refer to as Janus oscillators by analogy with Janus particles and the mythological figure from which their name is derived. In contrast to previous studies, these networks exhibit (i) explosive synchronization with identical oscillators; (ii) extreme multistability of chimera states, including traveling, intermittent, and bouncing chimeras; and (iii) asymmetry-induced synchronization in which synchronization is promoted by random oscillator heterogeneity. These networks also exhibit the previously unobserved possibility of inverted synchronization transitions, in which a transition to a more synchronous state is induced by a reduction rather than an increase in the coupling strength. These various phenomena are shown to emerge under rather parsimonious conditions, and even in locally connected ring topologies, which has the potential to facilitate their use to control and manipulate synchronization in experiments.", "citations": 17}

However, the majority of these works treat systems with a number of symmetries to simplify the analysis. In this work we study the role of symmetry and symmetry-breaking in the collective dynamics of coupled oscillator communities, allowing for a comparison between the macroscopic dynamics of symmetric and asymmetric systems. We begin by treating the symmetric case, deriving the bifurcation diagram as a function of intra- and inter-community coupling strengths. In particular we describe transitions between incoherence, standing wave, and partially synchronized states and reveal bistability regions. When we turn our attention to the asymmetric case we find that the symmetry-breaking complicates the bifurcation diagram. For instance, a pitchfork bifurcation in the symmetric case is broken, giving rise to a Hopf bifurcation. Moreover, an additional partially synchronized state emerges, as well as a new bistability region.\nGraphical abstract", "citations": 7}

There is also a transition, tipping, to homogeneous steady state (aging state) from the macroscopic oscillatory state. The limiting factor in the diffusive coupling favors the macroscopic oscillatory state even in the presence of a large fraction of inactive oscillators in the network thereby increasing the robustness of the network.

Here, we discuss the effect of different degrees of coupling strength symmetry breaking on the synchronization capability of the system. In particular, we find that proper coupling strength symmetry breaking is beneficial to enhance the synchronization capability of the system.

Since we give explicit conditions on the system parameters for such dynamics to arise, our results give insights into how network structure and interactions (which include higher-order interactions between oscillators) facilitate heteroclinic switching between localized frequency synchrony.", "citations": 26}

In particular, we show that, when amplitude dynamics is not negligible, phase synchronization may be enhanced. To illustrate this, we compare the behavior of heterogeneous units with both amplitude and phase dynamics and pure (Kuramoto) phase oscillators. We find that in small network motifs the behavior crucially depends on the topology and on the node frequency distribution. Surprisingly, the microscopic structures for which the amplitude dynamics improves synchronization are those that are statistically more abundant in random complex networks. Thus, amplitude dynamics leads to a general lowering of the synchronization threshold in arbitrary random topologies. Finally, we show that this synchronization enhancement is generic of oscillators close to Hopf bifurcations. To this aim we consider coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo units modeling neuron dynamics.", "citations": 24}

Although it was long thought that synchrony and disorder were mutually exclusive steady states for a network of identical oscillators, numerous theoretical studies in recent years have revealed the intriguing possibility of \u201cchimera states,\u201d in which the symmetry of the oscillator population is broken into a synchronous part and an asynchronous part. However, a striking lack of empirical evidence raises the question of whether chimeras are indeed characteristic of natural systems. This calls for a palpable realization of chimera states without any fine-tuning, from which physical mechanisms underlying their emergence can be uncovered. Here, we devise a simple experiment with mechanical oscillators coupled in a hierarchical network to show that chimeras emerge naturally from a competition between two antagonistic synchronization patterns. We identify a wide spectrum of complex states, encompassing and extending the set of previously described chimeras. Our mathematical model shows that the self-organization observed in our experiments is controlled by elementary dynamical equations from mechanics that are ubiquitous in many natural and technological systems. The symmetry-breaking mechanism revealed by our experiments may thus be prevalent in systems exhibiting collective behavior, such as power grids, optomechanical crystals, or cells communicating via quorum sensing in microbial populations.", "citations": 548}

In this paper, we examine the dynamical outcomes of moving agents interacting based upon their physical proximity. For this, we particularly emphasize on the impact of competing interactions among the agents depending on their physical distance. We specifically assume attractive coupling between agents which are staying apart from each other, whereas we adopt repulsive interaction for agents that are sufficiently close in space. With this set-up, we consider two types of coupling configurations, symmetry-breaking, and symmetry-preserving couplings. We encounter variants of collective dynamics ranging from synchronization, inhomogeneous small oscillation to cluster state, and extreme events while changing the attractive, and repulsive coupling strengths. We have been able to map all these dynamical behaviors in the coupling parameter space. Complete synchronization being the most desired state in absence of repulsive coupling, we present an analytical study for this scenario that agrees well with the numerical results.", "citations": 21}

One such extension replaces the coupling parameter with a coupling matrix, describing a form of generalized frustration with broken rotational symmetry. A key feature of this model is the existence of {\\it phase tuned states}, characterized by having the phase of the order parameter pointing in the direction of the dominant eigenvector of the coupling matrix.

Focusing on synchronization as the key task, we theoretically analyze heterogeneous coupled oscillators under both the all-to-all network and complex networks, and derive closed-form expressions for critical attack cost. Numerical simulations show strong agreement with theoretical predictions, validating the proposed framework.

Consequently, we observe the characteristic features of the phase diagrams of both the Kuramoto model and the Winfree model depending on the degree of the symmetry breaking coupling strength for unimodal frequency distribution. The phase diagrams of both the Kuramoto and the Winfree models resemble each other for symmetric bimodal frequency distribution for a range of the symmetry breaking coupling strength except for region shift and difference in the degree of spread of the macroscopic dynamical states and bistable regions. The dynamical transitions in the bistable states are characterized by an abrupt (first-order) transition in both the forward and reverse traces. For asymmetric bimodal frequency distribution, the onset of bistable regions depends on the degree of the asymmetry. Large degree of the symmetry breaking coupling strength promotes the synchronized stationary state, while a large degree of heterogeneity, proportional to the separation between the two central frequencies, facilitates the spread of the incoherent and standing wave states in the phase diagram for a low strength of the symmetry breaking coupling. We deduce the low-dimensional equations of motion for the complex order parameters using the Ott-Antonsen ansatz for both unimodal and bimodal frequency distributions.

We find that large values of the mean-field intensity near unity favor the oscillatory nature of the ensemble, whereas low values favor the onset of the aging transition and heterogeneous dynamical states such as cluster oscillation death and chimera death states even at low values of the symmetry breaking coupling strength. Heterogeneous dynamical states predominates at large values of the coupling strength in all available parameter spaces.

We introduce two mesoscopic model reductions for finite sparse networks of coupled oscillators to quantitatively capture the dynamics close to bifurcation from global to partial synchronization. Our model reduction builds upon the method of collective coordinates. We first show that standard collective coordinate reduction has difficulties capturing this bifurcation. We identify a particular topological structure at bifurcation consisting of a main synchronized cluster, the oscillator that desynchronizes at bifurcation, and an intermediary node connecting them. Utilizing this structure and ensemble averages, we derive an analytic expression for the mismatch between the true bifurcation from global to partial synchronization and its estimate calculated via the collective coordinate approach. This allows to calibrate the standard collective coordinate approach without prior knowledge of which node will desynchronize. We introduce a second mesoscopic reduction, utilizing the same particular topological structure, which allows for a quantitative dynamical description of the phases near bifurcation.

(2009) presented a novel data-driven framework to predict critical transitions in complex systems. These transitions, which may stem from failures, degradation, or adversarial actions, have been attributed to bifurcations in the nonlinear dynamics. Their approach was built upon the phenomenon of critical slowing down, i.e., slow recovery in response to small perturbations near bifurcations. We extend their approach to detect and localize critical transitions in nonlinear networks. By introducing the notion of network critical slowing down, the objective of this article is to detect that the network is undergoing a bifurcation only by analyzing its signatures from measurement data. We focus on two classes of widely used nonlinear networks: Kuramoto model for the synchronization of coupled oscillators, and attraction\u2013repulsion dynamics in swarms, each of which presents a specific type of bifurcation. Based on the phenomenon of critical slowing down, we study the asymptotic behavior of the perturbed system away and close to the bifurcation and leverage this fact to develop a deterministic method to detect and identify critical transitions in nonlinear networks. Furthermore, we study the state covariance matrix subject to a stochastic noise process away and close to the bifurcation and use it to develop a stochastic framework for detecting critical transitions. Our simulation results show the strengths and limitations of the methods.", "citations": 5}

In the coupled system, if the two oscillators have the same initial conditions, then the oscillators remain synchronized and exhibit the same canard behavior observed for the single oscillator. If the oscillators are separated initially, then in the region of the canard they display a variety of complex behaviors, including intermittent spiking, mixed-mode oscillation, and quasiperiodicity. Further variation of the parameter leads to a return to synchronized large-amplitude oscillation followed by a post-canard symmetry-breaking, in which one oscillator shows small-amplitude, complex behavior (mixed-mode oscillation, quasiperiodicity, chaos,...) while the other undergoes essentially periodic large amplitude behavior, resembling a master-slave scenario.

For a smaller voltage, the oscillators exhibit simple, so-called primary, clustering patterns, where all phase differences between each set of coupled oscillators are identical. However, upon increasing the voltage, secondary states, where phase differences differ, are detected, in addition to the primary states. Previous work on this system saw the development of a mathematical model that explained how the existence, stability, and common frequency of the experimentally observed cluster states could be accurately controlled by the delay time of the coupling. In this study, we revisit the mathematical model of the electrochemical oscillators in order to address open questions by means of bifurcation analysis. Our analysis reveals how the stable cluster states, corresponding to experimental observations, lose their stability via an assortment of bifurcation types. The analysis further reveals complex interconnectedness between branches of different cluster types. We find that each secondary state provides a continuous transition between certain primary states. These connections are explained by studying the phase space and parameter symmetries of the respective states. Furthermore, we show that it is only for a larger value of the voltage parameter that the branches of secondary states develop intervals of stability. For a smaller voltage, all the branches of secondary states are completely unstable and are, therefore, hidden to experimentalists.", "citations": 4}

We use the rotating periodic matrix in the rotating periodic theory to judge various types of synchronization phenomena, such as complete synchronization, anti-phase synchronization, periodic synchronization, or cluster synchronization. All rotating periodic matrices which satisfy the exchange invariance of multiple oscillators form special groups in these networks. By using the conjugate classes of these groups, we obtain various possible synchronization solutions in three networks. In particular, we find symmetry has different effects on synchronization in different networks.

Such systems can exhibit a wealth of phenomena that not only cannot be anticipated from merely examining their parts, as per the textbook definition of complexity, but also challenge intuition even when considered in the context of what is now known in network science. Here we review the recent literature on two major classes of such phenomena that have far-reaching implications: (i) antagonistic responses to changes of states or parameters and (ii) coexistence of seemingly incongruous behaviors or properties-both deriving from the collective and inherently decentralized nature of the dynamics. They include effects as diverse as negative compressibility in engineered materials, rescue interactions in biological networks, negative resistance in fluid networks, and the Braess paradox occurring across transport and supply networks. They also include remote synchronization, chimera states and the converse of symmetry breaking in brain, power-grid and oscillator networks as well as remote control in biological and bio-inspired systems.

Yet it displays an unexpectedly different behavior: in contrast to the lone stable chimera observed in continuous rings of oscillators, we find that this system exhibits two coexisting stable chimeras. Both chimeras are, as usual, born through a saddle-node bifurcation. As the coupling becomes increasingly local in nature they lose stability through a Hopf bifurcation, giving rise to breathing chimeras, which in turn get destroyed through a homoclinic bifurcation.

Further, we provide explicit expressions for synchronized and antisynchronized oscillatory states as well as the so called oscillation death (OD) state and study their stability. If the Hopf bifurcation parameter (\u03bb) is greater than the natural frequency (\u03c9) of the system, the attractive coupling favors the emergence of an antisymmetric OD state via a Hopf bifurcation whereas the repulsive coupling favors the emergence of a similar state through a saddle-node bifurcation.

This allows mapping the oscillators onto a system of coupled spins. Away from the bifurcation parameter values where the period-2 states emerge, the stationary state corresponds to having a microscopic current in the spin system, in the presence of disorder.

The effect of low pass filtering along with the mean-field parameter is explored in conjugately coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators. The dynamical transitions are examined via bifurcation analysis. We show the emergence of a spontaneous symmetry breaking (asymmetric) oscillatory state, which coexists with a nontrivial amplitude death state. Through the basin of attraction, the multi-stable nature of the spontaneous symmetry breaking state is examined, which reveals that the asymmetric distribution of the initial state favors the spontaneous symmetry breaking dynamics, while the symmetric distribution of initial states gives rise to the nontrivial amplitude death state.

We first explore the dynamics with a linear form of the adaptation function and discover a tiered transition to synchronization, along with continuous and abrupt routes to synchronization. Multiple routes to synchronization are also observed due to the presence of multiple stable states. We investigate the bifurcations behind these routes and illustrate the basin of attraction to attain a deeper understanding of the multistability that is born as a consequence of the adaptive interactions.

Recent work in physics and neuroscience highlights the importance of higher-order interactions between dynamical units, i.e., three- and four-way interactions in addition to pairwise interactions, and their role in shaping collective behavior. Here we show that higher-order interactions between coupled phase oscillators, encoded microscopically in a simplicial complex, give rise to added nonlinearity in the macroscopic system dynamics that induces abrupt synchronization transitions via hysteresis and bistability of synchronized and incoherent states. Moreover, these higher-order interactions can stabilize strongly synchronized states even when the pairwise coupling is repulsive. These findings reveal a self-organized phenomenon that may be responsible for the rapid switching to synchronization in many biological and other systems that exhibit synchronization without the need of particular correlation mechanisms between the oscillators and the topological structure. While first order phase transitions between incoherence and synchronization are critical for collective behavior in various oscillator system application, e.g., the brain and power grids, such transitions typically require finely tuned properties.

Example systems include Josephson junctions [1,2], lasers [3], oscillatory chemical reactions [4], heart pacemaker cells [5], central pattern generators [6], and cortical neural oscillators [7]. In many applications the oscillators are identical, dissipative, and the coupling is symmetric. Under such circumstances one can exploit the symmetry of the system to determine generic features of the dynamics such as the emergence of certain classes of solutions due to symmetry breaking bifurcations. Group-theoretic methods have been used to study both small amplitude oscillators on a ring near a Hopf bifurcation [8], and weakly coupled oscillators under phase averaging [9]. Symmetry arguments have also been used to construct central pattern generators for animal gaits [10] and to establish the existence of periodic orbits in Josephson junction series arrays [11]. Most work to date on the role of symmetry in coupled oscillator arrays has assumed that the interactions between elements of the array are smooth. On the other hand, many biological oscillators communicate with impulses as exemplified by the so-called integrate-and-fire model [12]. This latter model has recently sparked interest within the physics community due to connections with stick-slip models and self-organized criticality [13]. In Ref. [12], it was rigorously proved that globally coupled integrate-and-fire oscillators always synchronize in the presence of excitatory coupling. However, more biologically realistic models have spatially structured patterns of excitatory or inhibitory connections, and delayed couplings. It is an important issue to determine how the dynamics of pulse-coupled oscillators depends on the distribution of delays and the range of interactions. As we shall show here, the analysis of such systems is considerably facilitated by exploiting the underlying symmetries of the system. In this Letter we use group-theoretic methods to analyze the dynamics of a ring of N identical integrate-andfire oscillators with delayed interactions. In particular, we derive conditions for the existence of periodic, phaselocked solutions in which every oscillator fires with the same frequency; the latter is determined self-consistently. This set of conditions is invariant under the action of the spatiotemporal symmetry group DN 3 S 1 , where DN is the group of cyclic permutations and reflections in the ring and S 1 represents constant phase shifts in the direction of the flow. We classify the symmetries of the periodic solutions and indicate how this may be used to construct bifurcation diagrams. We also show how our results reduce to those of a corresponding phase-coupled model in the weak coupling regime.

We show that the networks exhibit diverse amplitude chimeras and oscillation death patterns. The occurrence of amplitude chimeras in a network of van der Pol oscillators is observed for the first time. A form of amplitude chimera, namely, \"damped amplitude chimera\" is observed and characterized, where the size of the incoherent region(s) increases continuously in the course of time, and the oscillations of drifting units are damped continuously until they are quenched to steady state. It is found that as the order of the fractional derivative decreases, the lifetime of classical amplitude chimeras increases, and there is a critical point at which there is a transition to damped amplitude chimeras. Overall, a decrease in the order of fractional derivatives reduces the propensity to synchronization and promotes oscillation death phenomena including solitary oscillation death and chimera death patterns that were unobserved in networks of integer-order oscillators. This effect of the fractional derivatives is verified by the stability analysis based on the properties of the master stability function of some collective dynamical states calculated from the block-diagonalized variational equations of the coupled systems.

We formulate a general mean-field theory (Vlasov-Focker Planck equation) for stochastic Kuramoto-type phase oscillator models, valid for coupling graphs/networks with heterogeneous connectivity and coupling strengths, using graphop theory in the mean-field limit. Considering symmetric odd-valued coupling functions, we mathematically prove an exact formula for the critical threshold for the incoherence-coherence transition. We numerically test the predicted threshold using large finite-size representations of the network model.

In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of a system of two delay-coupled oscillators and show that they display some kind of synchrony. We use the Stuart-Landau equations to represent this system, which is linked via conjugate coupling. These equations form a system of delay differential equations, which we have found to have symmetry isomorphic to Z2 \u00d7 Z2. We looked into the form of steady-states that inherit part of the symmetry of this system and the birth of periodic solutions with symmetry. In particular, we found bifurcating steady-state and periodic solutions with symmetry isomorphic to Z2 emanating from the branch of trivial solutions. As an illustration, we performed numerical continuation to generate a bifurcating branch of symmetric solutions from the branch of trivial solutions. These symmetric solutions provide us with the type of synchrony that can be displayed by the oscillators. Finally, we determined the stability of the different branches of symmetric solutions numerically.", "citations": 1}

These waves emerge from phase differences between neighboring oscillators, giving rise to stable periodic, quasiperiodic, or chaotic orbits. Rotating waves are observed in diverse non-linear systems like electrical circuits, neural models, and various oscillators. The study employs techniques such as time series and phase-space analyses, bifurcation diagrams, power spectra, and basins of attraction to unveil the intricate dynamics. These methods reveal the route from stable equilibria to hyperchaos through a series of bifurcations with increasing coupling strength, including Andronov-Hopf, torus, and crisis bifurcations. Notably, the research identifies instances of multiple coexisting rotating waves under the same parameters. Special attention is given to neural oscillators due to their significance in brain neural rings associated with working memory. The study of rotating waves finds broad relevance in fields like lasers, chemical reactions, cardiorespiratory systems, and particularly neural networks and brain function.", "citations": 0}

However, the early warning index used in this paper is an explicit function of the mutual information of the coupled oscillators and reaches two different values before the interacting oscillators yield complete and generalized synchronizations. The transitions to synchrony using the unconventional control parameter are associated with a transition to periodic dynamics of the individual oscillators from their initial chaotic dynamics. Besides, when we use the coupling strength as a control parameter, the interacting oscillator exhibits chaotic dynamics during the synchronizations. Our analysis mainly involves different examples of two low-dimensional oscillators. Finally, we extend our study to a network of interacting oscillators.

Building on the analytical calculations performed at the thermodynamic limit, we identify the origin of the synchronization transition that arises because of the finite size. We discover a power-law relationship between the network size and the critical coupling at which the first-order transition to synchronization occurs.

The systems are closed via the \u2019linear chain trick\u2019. Linear stability analysis of the systems and conditions for Hopf bifurcation that initiates oscillations are investigated, including deriving the normal form at bifurcation, and deducing the stability of the resulting limit cycle attractor. The value of the delay parameter a = aHopf at Hopf bifurcation picks out the onset of Amplitude Death(AD) in all three systems, with oscillations at larger values (corresponding to weaker delay). In both van der Pol systems, the Hopf-generated limit cycles for a > aHopf turn out to be remarkably stable under very large variations of all other system parameters beyond the Hopf bifurcation point, and do not undergo further symmetry breaking, cyclic-fold, flip, transcritical or Neimark-Sacker bifurcations. This is to be expected as the corresponding undelayed van der Pol systems are robust oscillators over very wide ranges of their respective parameters. Numerical simulations reveal strong distortion and rotation of the limit cycles in phase space as the parameters are pushed far into the post-Hopf regime, and also reveal other features, such as how the oscillation amplitudes and time periods of the physical variables on the limit cycle attractor change as the delay and other parameters are varied. For the chaotic system, very strong delays may still lead to the cessation of oscillations and the onset of AD (even for relatively large values of the system forcing which tends to oppose this phenomenon). Varying of the other important system parameter, the parametric excitation, leads to a rich sequence of dynamical behaviors, with the bifurcations leading from one regime (or type of attractor) into the next being carefully tracked.", "citations": 1}

Chimera states are chaotic patterns of spatially localized coherent and incoherent oscillations. The recently-introduced notion of a weak chimera gives a rigorously testable characterization of chimera states for finite-dimensional phase oscillator networks. In this paper we give some persistence results for dynamically invariant sets under perturbations and apply them to coupled populations of phase oscillators with generalized coupling. In contrast to the weak chimeras with nonpositive maximal Lyapunov exponents constructed so far, we show that weak chimeras that are chaotic can exist in the limit of vanishing coupling between coupled populations of phase oscillators. We present numerical evidence that positive Lyapunov exponents can persist for a positive measure set of this inter-population coupling strength.", "citations": 56}

In neuromorphic circuits, oscillators are used to replicate essential neural processes, such as synchronization, spiking, and rhythmic activity. To obtain these functions, a broad range of systems is investigated for artificial neurons, such as electrochemical autocatalytic systems, organic electrochemical transistors, and binary oxides memristors with an insulator\u2013metal transition. The general features of oscillators controlled by a single internal physical variable, which produces an S-type current\u2013voltage curve with a negative differential resistance, with matched external R and C elements, are discussed. The paper provides a classification of dynamical behaviors that will be found in the practical investigation and applications. A Hopf bifurcation ensures the existence of a limit cycle where the oscillations have small amplitude and nearly sinusoidal form. Slower relaxation oscillations occur at large values of the capacitor time constant since the internal variable becomes very fast in comparison to the variation of voltage. The values of the oscillation frequencies across the whole variation of bifurcation parameters are described, which facilitates the application of the oscillators in coupled configurations such as oscillating neural networks.", "citations": 6}
