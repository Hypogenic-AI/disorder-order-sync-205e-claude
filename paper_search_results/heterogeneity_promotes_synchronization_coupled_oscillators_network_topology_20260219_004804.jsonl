The many e\ufb00orts de- voted to understand synchronization phenomena in natural systems take now advantage of the recent theory of complex networks. In this review, we report the advances in the comprehension of synchronization phenomena when oscillating elements are constrained to interact in a complex network topology. We also overview the new emergent features coming out from the interplay between the structure and the function of the underlying pattern of connections. Extensive nu- merical work as well as analytical approaches to the problem are presented. Finally, we review several applications of synchronization in complex networks to di\ufb00erent disciplines: biological systems and neuroscience, engineering and computer science, and economy and social sciences.

INTRODUCTION Synchronization, as an emerging phenomenon of a pop- ulation of dynamically interacting units, has fascinated humans from ancestral times. No matter whether the phenomenon is spontaneous or induced, synchronization captivates our minds and becomes one of the most in- teresting scienti\ufb01c problems. Synchronization processes are ubiquitous in nature and play a very important role in many di\ufb00erent contexts as biology, ecology, climatol- ogy, sociology, technology, or even in arts ((Osipov et al., 2007; Pikovsky et al., 2001).

Here, we identify regimes for which the opposite occurs and show that oscillator heterogeneity can synchronize chaos for conditions under which identical oscillators cannot. This effect is not limited to small mismatches and is observed for random oscillator heterogeneity on both homogeneous and heterogeneous network structures. The results are demonstrated experimentally using networks of Chua's oscillators and are further supported by numerical simulations and theoretical analysis. In particular, we propose a general mechanism based on heterogeneity-induced mode mixing that provides insights into the observed phenomenon. Since individual differences are ubiquitous and often unavoidable in real systems, it follows that such imperfections can be an unexpected source of synchronization stability.", "citations": 22}

Heterogeneity in the degree distribution often reduces the average distance between nodes but, paradoxically, may suppress synchronization in networks of oscillators coupled symmetrically with uniform coupling strength. Here we offer a solution to this apparent paradox. Our analysis is partially based on the identification of a diffusive process underlying the communication between oscillators and reveals a striking relation between this process and the condition for the linear stability of the synchronized states. We show that, for a given degree distribution, the maximum synchronizability is achieved when the network of couplings is weighted and directed and the overall cost involved in the couplings is minimum. This enhanced synchronizability is solely determined by the mean degree and does not depend on the degree distribution and system size.

Several studies have explored and uncovered optimal topologies for synchronization by making purposeful alterations to a network. On the other hand, the connectivity patterns of many natural systems are often not static, but are rather modulated over time according to their dynamics. However, this co-evolution and the extent to which the dynamics of the individual units can shape the organization of the network itself are less well understood. Here, we study initially randomly connected but locally adaptive networks of Kuramoto oscillators. In particular, the system employs a co-evolutionary rewiring strategy that depends only on the instantaneous, pairwise phase differences of neighboring oscillators, and that conserves the total number of edges, allowing the effects of local reorganization to be isolated. We find that a simple rule\u2014which preserves connections between more out-of-phase oscillators while rewiring connections between more in-phase oscillators\u2014can cause initially disordered networks to organize into more structured topologies that support enhanced synchronization dynamics. We examine how this process unfolds over time, finding a dependence on the intrinsic frequencies of the oscillators, the global coupling, and the network density, in terms of how the adaptive mechanism reorganizes the network and influences the dynamics. Importantly, for large enough coupling and after sufficient adaptation, the resulting networks exhibit interesting characteristics, including degree\u2013frequency and frequency\u2013neighbor frequency correlations. These properties have previously been associated with optimal synchronization or explosive transitions in which the networks were constructed using global information. On the contrary, by considering a time-dependent interplay between structure and dynamics, this work offers a mechanism through which emergent phenomena and organization can arise in complex systems utilizing local rules.", "citations": 55}

Here we present the first general scheme for constructing AISync systems and demonstrate that this behavior is the norm rather than the exception in a wide class of physical systems that can be seen as multilayer networks.

These findings are matched by\"constructive\"theory: a nonlinear differential equation identifies which pairs of nodes are coupled, while a variational principle prescribes the budget allocated to each node.

Clustered and declustered rings are constructed to have the same node connectivity (the same number of links). The systems are chosen to be close-to-threshold, allowing global oscillations to be triggered by a weak diversity among the constituents that, by themselves, would be non-oscillating. The results clearly illustrate the crucial role played by network topology. In particular we found that network performance (activity and synchronization) is mainly determined by the network average path length. The shorter the average path length, the better the network performance. Local properties, as characterized by the clustering coefficient, are less important.

The complete bipartite network stands as an extreme example of this richness, where robust ideal driven clusters observed for the undelayed and homogeneously delayed cases dismantle, yielding versatile cluster patterns as heterogeneity in the delay is introduced.

Due to their nonlinear coupling, such networks typically have multiple stable and unstable states that a network might visit due to noise. In this article, we focus on the assessment of fluctuations resulting from heterogeneous and spatially correlated noise inputs on Kuramoto model networks. We evaluate the typical, small fluctuations near synchronized states and connect the network variance to the overlap between stable modes of synchronization and the input noise covariance. Going beyond small to large fluctuations, we introduce the indicator mode approximation that projects the dynamics onto a single amplitude dimension. Such an approximation allows for estimating rates of fluctuations to saddle instabilities, resulting in phase slips between connected oscillators. Statistics for both regimes are quantified in terms of effective noise amplitudes that are compared and contrasted for several noise models. Bridging the gap between small and large fluctuations, we show that a larger network variance does not necessarily lead to higher rates of large fluctuations.", "citations": 3}

When the interacting entities are identical and their coupling patterns are also identical, the complete synchronization of the entire network is the state inheriting the system symmetry. As in other systems subject to symmetry breaking, such symmetric states are not always stable. Here, we report on the discovery of the converse of symmetry breaking-the scenario in which complete synchronization is not stable for identically coupled identical oscillators but becomes stable when, and only when, the oscillator parameters are judiciously tuned to nonidentical values, thereby breaking the system symmetry to preserve the state symmetry. Aside from demonstrating that diversity can facilitate and even be required for uniformity and consensus, this suggests a mechanism for convergent forms of pattern formation in which initially asymmetric patterns evolve into symmetric ones.", "citations": 82}

Our approach is based on the simultaneous block diagonalization of the matrix terms in the variational equation, and it leads to dimension reduction that simplifies the original equation significantly. This new formalism allows the systematic investigation of scenarios in which the oscillators need to be nonidentical in order to reach an identical state, where all oscillators are completely synchronized. In the case of networks of identically coupled oscillators, this corresponds to breaking the symmetry of the system as a means to preserve the symmetry of the dynamical state\u2014 a recently discovered effect termed asymmetry-induced synchronization (AISync).

We address this open problem by studying the Synchrony Alignment Function (SAF), which is an objective measure for the synchronization properties of a network of heterogeneous oscillators with given natural frequencies. We extend the SAF framework to analyze network-coupled oscillators with heterogeneous natural frequencies that are drawn as a multivariate random vector. Using probability theory for quadratic forms, we obtain expressions for the expectation and variance of the SAF for given network structures.

The degree of synchrony and the effect of subnetwork topology are evaluated based on the Kuramoto order parameter and the minimum coupling strength necessary for the order parameter to exceed a threshold value, respectively. In contrast to an isolated network in which random connectivity is favorable for achieving synchrony, NoNs synchronize with weaker interconnections when the degree distribution of subnetworks is heterogeneous, suggesting the major role of the high-degree nodes. We also investigate a case in which subnetworks with different average natural frequencies are coupled to show that direct coupling of subnetworks with the largest variation is effective for synchronizing the whole system.

We find that in small network motifs the behavior crucially depends on the topology and on the node frequency distribution. Surprisingly, the microscopic structures for which the amplitude dynamics improves synchronization are those that are statistically more abundant in random complex networks.

Networks of coupled identical phase oscillators are good examples for analyzing these effects, since an overall synchronized state can be considered a reference state. A small variation of intrinsic node parameters may cause the system to move away from synchronization, and a new phase-locked stationary state can be achieved. We propose a measure of phase dispersion that quantifies the functional response of the system to a given local perturbation. As a particular implementation, we propose a variation of the standard Kuramoto model in which the nodes of a complex network interact with their neighboring nodes, by including a node-dependent frustration parameter. The final stationary phase-locked state now depends on the particular frustration parameter at each node and also on the network topology. We exploit this scenario by introducing individual frustration parameters and measuring what their effect on the whole network is, measured in terms of the phase dispersion, which depends only on the topology of the network and on the choice of the particular node that is perturbed. This enables us to define a characteristic of the node, its functionability, that can be computed analytically in terms of the network topology.

Here, we introduce a class of remarkably simple oscillator networks that concurrently exhibit all of these phenomena. The dynamical units consist of pairs of nonidentical phase oscillators, which we refer to as Janus oscillators by analogy with Janus particles and the mythological figure from which their name is derived. In contrast to previous studies, these networks exhibit (i) explosive synchronization with identical oscillators; (ii) extreme multistability of chimera states, including traveling, intermittent, and bouncing chimeras; and (iii) asymmetry-induced synchronization in which synchronization is promoted by random oscillator heterogeneity. These networks also exhibit the previously unobserved possibility of inverted synchronization transitions, in which a transition to a more synchronous state is induced by a reduction rather than an increase in the coupling strength. These various phenomena are shown to emerge under rather parsimonious conditions, and even in locally connected ring topologies, which has the potential to facilitate their use to control and manipulate synchronization in experiments.", "citations": 17}

It is nowadays a well-known fact that the synchronization processes are gradually influenced by the interaction topology between the dynamically interacting units. A complex coupling configuration can significantly affect the synchronization abilities of a networked system. However, the question arises what is the optimal network topology that provides enhancement of the synchronization features under given circumstances. In order to address this issue we make use of a network model in which we can smoothly tune the topology from a highly heterogeneous and efficient scale-free network to a homogeneous and less efficient network. The network is then populated with Poincar\u00e9 oscillators, a paradigmatic model for limit-cycle oscillations. This oscillator model exhibits a parameter that enables changes of the limit cycle attraction and is thus immediately related to flexibility/rigidity properties of the oscillator. Our results reveal that for weak attractions of the limit cycle, intermediate homogeneous topology ensures maximal synchronization, whereas highly heterogeneous scale-free topology ensures maximal synchronization for strong attractions of the limit cycle. We argue that the flexibility/rigidity of individual nodes of the networks defines the topology, where maximal global coherence is achieved.", "citations": 2}

The local dynamics is chaotic in the absence of coupling and thus the network is a paradigm of a complex system. There are two regimes of synchronization, depending on the distribution of delays: when the delays are sufficiently heterogeneous the network synchronizes on a steady-state (that is unstable for the uncoupled maps); when the delays are homogeneous, it synchronizes in a time-dependent state (that is either periodic or chaotic). Using two global indicators we quantify the synchronizability on the two regimes, focusing on the roles of the network connectivity and the topology. The connectivity is measured in terms of the average number of links per node, and we consider various topologies (scale-free, small-world, star, and nearest-neighbor with and without a central hub). With weak connectivity and weak coupling strength, the network displays an irregular oscillatory dynamics that is largely independent of the topology and of the delay distribution. With heterogeneous delays, we find a threshold connectivity level below which the network does not synchronize, regardless of the network size. This minimum average number of neighbors seems to be independent of the delay distribution. We also analyze the effect of self-feedback loops and find that they have an impact on the synchronizability of small networks with large coupling strengths.

Using synchronization metrics, we find a wide variety of emergent multi-scale behaviour, such as (i) a transition from intermittent frequency locking on a $\\mathbb {T}^{3}$ quasiperiodic attractor to a breathing chimera, (ii) a two-cluster state of anti-phase synchronization on a periodic limit cycle, and (iii) a weak anti-phase chimera. We then compute the cross-transitivity from recurrence networks to identify the dominant direction of the coupling between the heat-release-rate ($q^{\\prime }_{\\mathbb {X}}$) and pressure ($p^{\\prime }_{\\mathbb {X}}$) fluctuations in each individual oscillator, as well as that between the pressure ($p^{\\prime }_{\\mathbb {X}}$ and $p^{\\prime }_{\\mathbb {Y}}$) fluctuations in each pair of coupled oscillators. We find that networks of non-identical oscillators exhibit circumferentially biased $p^{\\prime }_{\\mathbb {X}}$\u2013$p^{\\prime }_{\\mathbb {Y}}$ coupling, leading to mode localization, whereas networks of identical oscillators exhibit globally symmetric $p^{\\prime }_{\\mathbb {X}}$\u2013$p^{\\prime }_{\\mathbb {Y}}$ coupling. In both types of networks, we find that the $p^{\\prime }_{\\mathbb {X}}$\u2013$q^{\\prime }_{\\mathbb {X}}$ coupling can be symmetric or asymmetric, but that the asymmetry is always such that $q^{\\prime }_{\\mathbb {X}}$ exerts a greater influence on $p^{\\prime }_{\\mathbb {X}}$ than vice versa. Finally, we show through a cluster analysis that the $p^{\\prime }_{\\mathbb {X}}$\u2013$p^{\\prime }_{\\mathbb {Y}}$ interactions play a more critical role than the $p^{\\prime }_{\\mathbb {X}}$\u2013$q^{\\prime }_{\\mathbb {X}}$ interactions in defining the collective dynamics of the system. As well as providing new insight into the interplay between the $p^\\prime_{\\mathbb{X}}\\text{--}p^\\prime_{\\mathbb{Y}}$ and $p^\\prime_{\\mathbb{X}}\\text{--}q^\\prime_{\\mathbb{X}}$ coupling, this study shows that even a small network of four ring-coupled thermoacoustic oscillators can exhibit a wide variety of collective dynamics. In particular, we present the first evidence of chimera states in a minimal network of coupled thermoacoustic oscillators, paving the way for the application of oscillation quenching strategies based on chimera control.", "citations": 34}

This includes scenarios in which interacting entities are required to be non-identical in order to exhibit identical behaviour, such as in reaching consensus. Here we present an experimental demonstration of this phenomenon. Using a network of alternating-current electromechanical oscillators, we show that their ability to achieve identical frequency synchronization is enhanced when the oscillators are tuned to be suitably non-identical and that converse symmetry breaking persists for a range of noise levels.

We find that, while too weak a coupling is not sufficient for the whole system to synchronize, too strong a coupling induces a nontrivial type of phase slip among oscillators, resulting in synchronization failure. Thus, an intermediate coupling range for synchronization exists, which becomes narrower when the network is more heterogeneous. Analyses of two noisy oscillators reveal that nontrivial phase slip is a generic phenomenon when noise is present and coupling is strong. Therefore, the low synchronizability of heterogeneous networks can be understood as a result of the difference in effective coupling strength among oscillators with different degrees; oscillators with high degrees tend to undergo phase slip while those with low degrees have weak coupling strengths that are insufficient for synchronization.", "citations": 2}

It is generally believed that homogeneity among the entities is beneficial for synchronization. This work shows theoretically, numerically, and experimentally that the opposite is not only possible but also common in systems with interaction delays. In such systems, heterogeneity among the entities is shown to promote synchronization, even when the heterogeneity is completely random. This finding advances our understanding of the interplay between order and disorder in the collective behavior of complex systems. We suggest that the phenomenon can be observed for diverse coupling schemes and has implications for real-world systems, where heterogeneity and delays are common and often unavoidable. A widely held assumption on network dynamics is that similar components are more likely to exhibit similar behavior than dissimilar ones and that generic differences among them are necessarily detrimental to synchronization. Here, we show that this assumption does not generally hold in oscillator networks when communication delays are present. We demonstrate, in particular, that random parameter heterogeneity among oscillators can consistently rescue the system from losing synchrony. This finding is supported by electrochemical-oscillator experiments performed on a multielectrode array network. Remarkably, at intermediate levels of heterogeneity, random mismatches are more effective in promoting synchronization than parameter assignments specifically designed to facilitate identical synchronization. Our results suggest that, rather than being eliminated or ignored, intrinsic disorder in technological and biological systems can be harnessed to help maintain coherence required for function.", "citations": 43}

In this Letter, we show that frequency heterogeneity among oscillators can induce stable cyclops and cluster states in Kuramoto networks with higher-mode coupling, even though these states are unstable in the identical oscillator case. Cyclops states, introduced in [Munyaev et\u00a0al., Phys. Rev.

Surprisingly, heterogeneity alone is sufficient to stabilize these patterns across a sizable range of detuning values without needing to be compensated by other forms of disorder or external tuning. To explain this effect, we introduce a mesoscopic collective coordinate approach that links microscopic frequency structure with mean-field cluster-level stability. Importantly, we demonstrate that the same disorder-induced stabilization mechanism also arises robustly in biologically and physically grounded networks of Winfree and Stuart-Landau oscillators, pointing to its generality and opening directions for designing multistate dynamics in heterogeneous networks.", "citations": 0}

In systems where component heterogeneity can be tuned and controlled, we show how the complex collective self-organized dynamics can be guided towards synchronized states with specific operational frequencies and phase relations. This is of importance for the technical applicability of self-organized dynamics.

This optimum appears for any fixed configuration of intrinsic frequency detuning and scales inversely with the number of lasers, leading to a linear scaling of the total coupling cost with the number of lasers.

Here, we study the intralayer synchrony in multiplex networks, where the layers are different from one other, due to parameter mismatch in their local dynamics. In such a multiplex network, the intralayer coupling strength for the emergence of intralayer synchronization decreases upon the introduction of impurity among the layers, which is caused by a parameter mismatch in their local dynamics. Furthermore, the area of occurrence of intralayer synchronization also widens with increasing mismatch. We analytically derive a condition under which the intralayer synchronous solution exists, and we even sustain its stability.

It stems from this characterization that negative interactions as well as link removals can be used to systematically improve and optimize synchronization properties in both directed and undirected networks. These results extend the recently discovered compensatory perturbations in metabolic networks to the realm of oscillator networks and demonstrate why \u201cless can be more\u201d in network synchronization.", "citations": 171}

At the most fundamental level, many synchronization patterns are induced by underlying network symmetry, and a high degree of symmetry is believed to enhance the stability of identical synchronization.

This counterintuitive effect holds for generic node dynamics and arbitrary network structure and is, moreover, robust against noise and imperfections typical of real systems, which we demonstrate by implementing a state-of-the-art optoelectronic experiment.

The Kuramoto model provides a foundational framework for understanding synchronization among coupled oscillators, traditionally assuming pairwise interactions. However, many real-world systems exhibit group and many-body interactions, which can be effectively modeled through hypergraphs. Previous studies suggest that higher-order interactions shrink the attraction basin of the synchronous state, making it harder to reach and potentially impairing synchronization, despite enriching the dynamics. In this work, we show that this is not always the case. Through a numerical study of higher-order Kuramoto models on random hypergraphs, we find that while strong higher-order interactions do generally work against synchronization, weak higher-order interactions can actually enhance it when combined with pairwise ones. This result is further corroborated by a cost-benefit analysis: under a constrained budget of both pairwise and higher-order interactions, a mixed allocation involving both consistently achieves higher synchronization than relying on either interaction type alone. These findings provide new insights into the role of higher-order interactions in shaping collective dynamics and point to design principles for optimizing synchronization in complex systems.", "citations": 3}

Here, we analyze synchronization features in networks in which structural and dynamical features co-evolve. The feedback of the node dynamics on the interaction pattern is ruled by the competition of two mechanisms: homophily (reinforcing those interactions with other correlated units in the graph) and homeostasis (preserving the value of the input strength received by each unit).

Results demonstrate that extremely small phase perturbations applied to network oscillators can achieve significant synchronization control across diverse network architectures. Our analysis reveals that synchronization enhancement is achievable across various network sizes, while synchronization suppression becomes particularly effective in larger networks, with effectiveness scaling favorably with the network size.

One significant phenomenon induced by interactions is synchronization of coupled agents, and the interactive network topology can be tuned to optimize synchronization. Previous studies showed that the optimized conventional network with pairwise interactions favors a homogeneous degree distribution of nodes for undirected interactions, and is always structurally asymmetric for directed interactions. However, the optimal control on synchronization for prevailing higher-order interactions is less explored. Here, by considering the higher-order interactions in a hypergraph and the Kuramoto model with 2-hyperlink interactions, we find that the network topology with optimized synchronizability may have distinct properties. For undirected interactions, optimized networks with 2-hyperlink interactions by simulated annealing tend to become homogeneous in the nodes\u2019 generalized degree. We further rigorously demonstrate that for directed interactions, the structural symmetry can be preserved in the optimally synchronizable network with 2-hyperlink interactions.

These turn out to be related to Ramanujan and Cage graphs. We argue also that these graphs are very good finite-size approximations to Bethe lattices, and provide optimal or almost optimal solutions to many other problems, for instance searchability in the presence of congestion or performance of neural networks.

While the effect of the arrangement of structural connections on the emergent synchronization pattern has been studied extensively, considerably less is known about its influence on the temporal dynamics unfolding within each node. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation across diverse simulated and experimental systems, encompassing star and complex networks of R\u00f6ssler systems, coupled hysteresis-based electronic oscillators, microcircuits of leaky integrate-and-fire model neurons, and finally recordings from in-vitro cultures of spontaneously-growing neuronal networks. We systematically consider a range of dynamical measures, including the correlation dimension, nonlinear prediction error, permutation entropy, and other information-theoretical indices. The empirical evidence gathered reveals that under situations of weak synchronization, wherein rather than a collective behavior one observes significantly differentiated dynamics, denser connectivity tends to locally promote the emergence of stronger signatures of nonlinear dynamics. In deterministic systems, transition to chaos and generation of higher-dimensional signals were observed; however, when the coupling is stronger, this relationship may be lost or even inverted. In systems with a strong stochastic component, the generation of more temporally-organized activity could be induced.

Often, such modularity is manifested at several different hierarchical levels, where the clusters defined at one level appear as elementary entities at the next higher level. Using a simple model of a hierarchical modular network, we show that such a topological structure gives rise to characteristic time-scale separation between dynamics occurring at different levels of the hierarchy. This generalizes our earlier result for simple modular networks, where fast intramodular and slow intermodular processes were clearly distinguished. Investigating the process of synchronization of oscillators in a hierarchical modular network, we show the existence of as many distinct time-scales as there are hierarchical levels in the system. This suggests a possible functional role of such mesoscopic organization principle in natural systems, viz., in the dynamical separation of events occurring at different spatial scales.", "citations": 7}

The linear stability of the synchronous state is linked to an algebraic condition of the Laplacian matrix of the network.

Applied to networks of low redundancy, the small-world route produces synchronizability more efficiently than standard deterministic graphs, purely random graphs, and ideal constructive schemes. However, the small-world property does not guarantee synchronizability: the synchronization threshold lies within the boundaries, but linked to the end of the small-world region.", "citations": 1448}

On the contrary, the appearance of complete synchronization is radically affected by the structure of the networks. Our study highlights the need of exploring the whole phase diagram and not only the stability of the fully synchronized state, where most studies have been done up to now.", "citations": 16}

Also, they are characterized by a very interwoven (entangled) structure with short average distances, large loops, and no well-defined community structure. This family of nets exhibits an excellent performance with respect to other flow properties such as robustness against errors and attacks, minimal first-passage time of random walks, efficient communication, etc. These remarkable features convert entangled networks in a useful concept, optimal or almost optimal in many senses, and with plenty of potential applications in computer science or neuroscience.", "citations": 317}

Bassett", "url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusId:221969963", "relevance": 1, "abstract": "In networks of coupled oscillators, it is of interest to understand how interaction topology affects synchronization. Many studies have gained key insights into this question by studying the classic Kuramoto oscillator model on static networks. However, new questions arise when the network structure is time varying or when the oscillator system is multistable, the latter of which can occur when an inertial term is added to the Kuramoto model. While the consequences of evolving topology and multistability on collective behavior have been examined separately, real-world systems such as gene regulatory networks and the brain may exhibit these properties simultaneously. It is thus relevant to ask how time-varying network connectivity impacts synchronization in systems that can exhibit multistability. To address this question, we study how the dynamics of coupled Kuramoto oscillators with inertia are affected when the topology of the underlying network changes in time. We show that hysteretic synchronization behavior in networks of coupled inertial oscillators can be driven by changes in connection topology alone. Moreover, we find that certain fixed-density rewiring schemes induce significant changes to the level of global synchrony that remain even after the network returns to its initial configuration, and we show that these changes are robust to a wide range of network perturbations. Our findings highlight that the specific progression of network topology over time, in addition to its initial or final static structure, can play a considerable role in modulating the collective behavior of systems evolving on complex networks.", "citations": 5}

We transform the synchronization of impulsive coupled oscillators into the existence of rotating periodic solutions in a relevant impulsive system.

The dynamics of this system depend mostly on both the number of long-range connections or \"shortcuts\", and the delay associated with neuronal interactions. We find that persistent activity emerges at low density of shortcuts, and that the system undergoes a transition to failure as their density reaches a critical value. The state of persistent activity below this transition consists of multiple stable periodic attractors, whose number increases at least as fast as the number of neurons in the network. At large shortcut density and for long enough delays the network dynamics exhibit exceedingly long chaotic transients, whose failure times follow a stretched exponential distribution. We show that this functional form arises for the ensemble-averaged activity if the failure time for each individual network realization is exponentially distributed.", "citations": 68}

Such systems are the basis for critical infrastructure such as satellite navigation, mobile communications, and services like the precision time protocol and Universal Coordinated Time. Different concepts for the synchronization of oscillator networks have been proposed, in particular mutual synchronization without and hierarchical synchronization from a reference clock. Established network synchronization models in electrical engineering address the role of inevitable cross-coupling time delays for network synchronization. Mutual synchronization has been studied using linear approximations of the coupling functions of these models. We review previous work and present a general model in which we study synchronization taking into account nonlinearities and finite time delays. As a result, dynamical phenomena in networks of coupled electronic oscillators induced by time delays, such as the multistability and stabilization of synchronized states can be predicted and observed. We study the linear stability of nonlinear states and predict for which system parameters synchronized states can be stable. We use these results to discuss the implementation of mutual synchronization for complex system architectures. A key finding is that mutual synchronization can result in stable in- and anti-phase synchronized states in the presence of large time delays. We provide the condition for which such synchronized states are guaranteed to be stable.", "citations": 12}
