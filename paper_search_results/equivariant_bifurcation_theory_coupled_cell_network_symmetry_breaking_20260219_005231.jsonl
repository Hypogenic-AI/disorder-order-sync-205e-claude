There are also surprises in the dynamical complexity of the attractors that can robustly appear\u2014for example, heteroclinic network attractors.

Molecular network motifs like positive feedback and mutual repressor exhibit bifurcation and are responsible for the emergence of diverse cell types. Mathematical investigations of such problems usually focus on bifurcation in a molecular network in individual cells. However, in a multicellular organism, cells interact, and intercellular interactions affect individual cell dynamics. Therefore, the bifurcation in an ensemble of cells could differ from that for a single cell. This work considers a ring of identical cells. When independent, each cell exhibits supercritical pitchfork bifurcation. Using analytical and numerical tools, we investigate the bifurcation in this ensemble when cells interact through positive and negative coupling. We show that within a specific parameter zone, an ensemble of positively coupled cells behaves like a single cell with supercritical pitchfork bifurcation. In this regime, all cells are synchronized and have the same steady state. However, this unique behaviour is lost when cells interact through negative coupling. Apart from the synchronized (or homogenous) states, cell-cell coupling leads to certain heterogeneous steady states with unique patterns. We also investigate the distribution of such heterogeneous states under positive and negative coupling.", "citations": 0}

Although in both cases the bifurcation structure is determined by symmetries in the system, the behavior of the two systems is qualitatively different. In the all-to-all connected network, the system undergoes Hopf bifurcations leading to periodic orbit solutions; notably, for large $g$, there is a single, stable periodic orbit solution and no stable fixed points.

Biological and artificial multi-agent systems, from honeybees and bird flocks to bacteria, robots, and humans, often need to overcome indecision when choosing among options in situations in which the performance or even the survival of the group are at stake. Breaking indecision is also important because in a fully indecisive state agents are not biased toward any specific option and therefore the agent group is maximally sensitive and prone to adapt to inputs and changes in its environment. Here, we develop a mathematical theory to study how decisions arise from the breaking of indecision. Our approach is grounded in both equivariant and network bifurcation theory. We model decision from indecision as synchrony-breaking in influence networks in which each node is the value assigned by an agent to an option. First, we show that three universal decision behaviors, namely, deadlock, consensus, and dissensus, are the generic outcomes of synchrony-breaking bifurcations from a fully synchronous state of indecision in influence networks. Second, we show that all deadlock and consensus value patterns and some dissensus value patterns are predicted by the symmetry of the influence networks. Third, we show that there are also many `exotic' dissensus value patterns. These patterns are predicted by network architecture, but not by network symmetries, through a new synchrony-breaking branching lemma. This is the first example of exotic solutions in an application. Numerical simulations of a novel influence network model illustrate our theoretical results.", "citations": 3}

These coupling-induced collective oscillations of bistable one-dimensional units are captured by the model. Moreover, any equilibrium is contained in a cluster subspace, where the electrodes take at most three distinct states. We systematically analyze the dynamics and bifurcations of the model equations: We consider the dynamics on cluster subspaces of successively increasing dimension and analyze the bifurcations occurring therein. Most importantly, the system exhibits an equivariant transcritical bifurcation of limit cycles. From this bifurcation, several limit cycles branch, one of which is stable for arbitrarily many bistable units.", "citations": 0}

We assume that the visual system has previously learned that certain combinations are geometrically consistent or inconsistent, and model this knowledge by adding suitable excitatory and inhibitory connections between attribute levels.

The main results analyze a more elaborate model for the Necker cube, a 16-node Wilson network whose nodes represent alternative orientations of specific segments of the image. Symmetric Hopf bifurcation is used to show that a small list of natural local geometric consistency conditions leads to alternation between two global percepts: cubes in two different orientations. The model also predicts brief transitional states in which the percept involves impossible rectangles analogous to the Penrose triangle. A tristable illusion generalizing the Necker cube is modelled in a similar manner.", "citations": 6}

Here, we show how symmetry explains the relation between behavior of systems with one-dimensional internal dynamics and with higher dimensional internal dynamics, when the network topology is the same. Fundamental networks of homogeneous coupled cell systems (B. Rink, J. Sanders. Coupled Cell Networks and Their Hidden Symmetries. SIAM J. Math. Anal. 46.2 (2014)) can be expressed in terms of monoid representations, which uniquely decompose into indecomposable subrepresentations. In the high-dimensional internal dynamics case, these subrepresentations are isomorphic to multiple copies of those one computes in the one-dimensional case. We describe the implications of this observation on steady state and Hopf bifurcations in $l$-parameter families of network vector fields. The main results are that (1) generic one-parameter steady state bifurcations are qualitatively independent of the dimension of the internal dynamics and that, (2) in order to observe all generic $l$-parameter bifurcations that may occur for internal dynamics of any dimension, the internal dynamics has to be at least $l$-dimensional for steady state bifurcations and $2l$-dimensional for Hopf bifurcations. Furthermore, we illustrate how additional structure in the network can be exploited to obtain understanding beyond qualitative statements about the collective dynamics. One-parameter steady state bifurcations in feedforward networks exhibit an unusual amplification in the asymptotic growth rates of individual cells, when these are one-dimensional (S. von der Gracht, E. Nijholt, B. Rink. Amplified steady state bifurcations in feedforward networks. Nonlinearity 35.4 (2022)). We prove that (3) the same cells exhibit this amplifying effect with the same growth rates when the internal dynamics is high-dimensional.", "citations": 0}

The EBL can be interpreted as the application of the BSE Theorem to a fixed point subspace. There are functions which have invariant linear subspaces that are not caused by symmetry. For example, networks of identical coupled cells often have such invariant subspaces. We present a generalization of the EBL, where the BSE Theorem is applied to nested invariant subspaces. We call this the Bifurcation Lemma for Invariant Subspaces (BLIS). We give several examples of bifurcations and determine if BSE, EBL, or BLIS apply.

However, they do not describe well the behavior of networks composed of a small number of neurons. In this case, major differences between the mean-field approximation and the real behavior of the network can arise. Yet, many interesting problems in neuroscience involve the study of mesoscopic networks composed of a few tens of neurons. Nonetheless, mathematical methods that correctly describe networks of small size are still rare, and this prevents us to make progress in understanding neural dynamics at these intermediate scales. Here we develop a novel systematic analysis of the dynamics of arbitrarily small networks composed of homogeneous populations of excitatory and inhibitory firing-rate neurons. We study the local bifurcations of their neural activity with an approach that is largely analytically tractable, and we numerically determine the global bifurcations. We find that for strong inhibition these networks give rise to very complex dynamics, caused by the formation of multiple branching solutions of the neural dynamics equations that emerge through spontaneous symmetry-breaking. This qualitative change of the neural dynamics is a finite-size effect of the network, that reveals qualitative and previously unexplored differences between mesoscopic cortical circuits and their mean-field approximation. The most important consequence of spontaneous symmetry-breaking is the ability of mesoscopic networks to regulate their degree of functional heterogeneity, which is thought to help reducing the detrimental effect of noise correlations on cortical information processing.", "citations": 10}

However, the symmetries of globally and identically coupled identical units do not allow solutions where distinct oscillators are frequency-unlocked-a necessary condition for the emergence of chimeras. Thus, forced symmetry breaking is necessary to observe chimera-type solutions. Here, we consider the bifurcations that arise when full permutational symmetry is broken for the network to consist of coupled populations. We consider the smallest possible network composed of four phase oscillators and elucidate the phase space structure, (partial) integrability for some parameter values, and how the bifurcations away from full symmetry lead to frequency-unlocked weak chimera solutions. Since such solutions wind around a torus they must arise in a global bifurcation scenario. Moreover, periodic weak chimeras undergo a period-doubling cascade leading to chaos. The resulting chaotic dynamics with distinct frequencies do not rely on amplitude variation and arise in the smallest networks that support chaos.", "citations": 13}

Outside of the union of these cells, the two bulk species with comparable diffusivities and bulk degradation rates diffuse and globally couple the spatially segregated intracellular reactions through Robin boundary conditions across the cell boundaries, which depend on certain membrane reaction rates. In the singular limit of a small common cell radius, we construct steady-state solutions for the bulk-cell model and formulate a nonlinear matrix eigenvalue problem that determines the linear stability properties of the steady-states. For a certain spatial arrangement of cells for which the steady-state and linear stability analysis become highly tractable, we construct a symmetric steady-state solution where the steady-states of the intracellular species are the same for each cell. As regulated by the ratio of the membrane reaction rates on the cell boundaries, we show for various specific prototypical intracellular reactions, and for a specific two-cell arrangement, that our 2-D coupled PDE-ODE model admits symmetry-breaking bifurcations from this symmetric steady-state, leading to linearly stable asymmetric patterns, even when the bulk diffusing species have comparable or possibly equal diffusivities. Overall, our analysis shows that symmetry-breaking bifurcations can occur without the large diffusivity ratio requirement for the bulk diffusing species as is well-known from a Turing stability analysis applied to a spatially uniform steady-state for typical two-component activator-inhibitor systems. Instead, for our theoretical compartmental-reaction diffusion bulk-cell model, our analysis shows that the emergence of stable asymmetric steady-states can be controlled by the ratio of the membrane reaction rates for the two species.

By changing the coupling strength, the two types of chimera patterns can be induced. We find numerically that the amplitude chimeras are not short-living transients but can have a long lifetime. Also, we observe variants of the amplitude chimeras with quasiperiodic temporal oscillations. We provide a qualitative explanation of the observed phenomena in the light of symmetry breaking bifurcation scenarios.

We explore different functional possibilities for motifs involving symmetry breaking and heterogeneity. This is achieved by varying coupling properties of the synapses between the cells and studying the qualitative changes in the structure of the corresponding return maps. Our findings provide a systematic basis for understanding plausible biophysical mechanisms for the regulation of rhythmic patterns generated by various CPGs in the context of motor control such as gait-switching in locomotion.

Increasing the heterogeneity, using the standard deviation of the Hopf bifurcation parameter, favors the macroscopic oscillatory state for low values of the symmetry breaking coupling and inhomogeneous steady state for larger values of the coupling. There is also a transition, tipping, to homogeneous steady state (aging state) from the macroscopic oscillatory state. The limiting factor in the diffusive coupling favors the macroscopic oscillatory state even in the presence of a large fraction of inactive oscillators in the network thereby increasing the robustness of the network. The globally coupled oscillators are reduced to a system of two evolution equations for the macroscopic order parameters, corresponding to the mean field and the shape parameter, using the self-consistent field approach. The bifurcation diagrams obtained from the mean-field variables elucidate various bifurcation scenarios responsible for the dynamical transitions observed in N globally coupled Stuart\u2013Landau oscillators. In particular, tipping to the aging state is found to occur via the Hopf and pitchfork bifurcations illustrating the phenomenon of bifurcation-induced tipping.

Using tools from group theory, this approach has recently been extended to treat more general cluster states. However, the MSF and its generalizations require the determination of a set of Floquet multipliers from variational equations obtained by linearization around a periodic orbit. Since closed form solutions for periodic orbits are invariably hard to come by, the framework is often explored using numerical techniques. Here, we show that further insight into network dynamics can be obtained by focusing on piecewise linear (PWL) oscillator models. Not only do these allow for the explicit construction of periodic orbits, their variational analysis can also be explicitly performed. The price for adopting such nonsmooth systems is that many of the notions from smooth dynamical systems, and in particular linear stability, need to be modified to take into account possible jumps in the components of Jacobians. This is naturally accommodated with the use of saltation matrices. By augmenting the variational approach for studying smooth dynamical systems with such matrices we show that, for a wide variety of networks that have been used as models of biological systems, cluster states can be explicitly investigated. By way of illustration, we analyze an integrate-and-fire network model with event-driven synaptic coupling as well as a diffusively coupled network built from planar PWL nodes, including a reduction of the popular Morris-Lecar neuron model. We use these examples to emphasize that the stability of network cluster states can depend as much on the choice of single node dynamics as it does on the form of network structural connectivity. Importantly, the procedure that we present here, for understanding cluster synchronization in networks, is valid for a wide variety of systems in biology, physics, and engineering that can be described by PWL oscillators.", "citations": 17}

In contrast to traditional approaches that focus on specific equations, our method relies solely on general assumptions about global intercellular communication (between cells) and qualitative properties of local intracellular biochemical signaling (within cells). Prior work has shown that global intercellular communication networks alone determine the possible emergent patterns in a generic system. We build on these results by demonstrating that additional constraints on the local intracellular signaling network lead to a single stable pattern which depends on the qualitative features of the network.

The 2002 discovery of so-called chimera states, states of coexisting synchronized and unsynchronized oscillators, provided a possible link between the two and definitely showed that different parts of the same ensemble can sustain qualitatively different forms of motion. Here, we demonstrate that globally coupled identical oscillators can express a range of coexistence patterns more comprehensive than chimeras. A hierarchy of such states evolves from the fully synchronized solution in a series of cluster-splittings. At the far end of this hierarchy, the states further collide with their own mirror-images in phase space \u2013 rendering the motion chaotic, destroying some of the clusters and thereby producing even more intricate coexistence patterns. A sequence of such attractor collisions can ultimately lead to full incoherence of only single asynchronous oscillators. Chimera states, with one large synchronized cluster and else only single oscillators, are found to be just one step in this transition from low- to high-dimensional dynamics. Systems of interacting oscillatory units show various types of dynamics, from uniform low-dimensional motion to high-dimensional disorder.

A feed-forward system is a dynamical system that respects the structure of a feed-forward network. The synchrony subspaces for a network, are the subspaces defined by equalities of some cell coordinates, that are flow-invariant by all the network systems. The restriction of a network system to each of its synchrony subspaces is a system associated with a smaller network, which may be, or not, a feed-forward network. The original network is then said to be a lift of the smaller network. We show that a feed-forward lift of a feed-forward network is given by the composition of two types of lifts: lifts that create new layers and lifts inside a layer. Furthermore, we address the lifting bifurcation problem on feed-forward systems. More precisely, the comparison of the possible codimension-one local steady-state bifurcations of a feed-forward system and those of the corresponding lifts is considered. We show that for most of the feed-forward lifts, the increase of the center subspace is a sufficient condition for the existence of additional bifurcating branches of solutions, which are not lifted from the restricted system. However, when the bifurcation condition is associated with the internal dynamics and the lift occurs inside an intermediate layer, we prove that the existence of a bifurcation branch not lifted from the restricted system does depend generically on the chosen feed-forward system.", "citations": 10}

There exist two parameter areas where the in-phase rotational motion is unstable and out-of-phase rotations are realized. Asymptotic theory is developed that allows us to analytically identify borders of instability areas of in-phase rotation motion. It is shown that out-of-phase rotations are the result of the parametric instability of in-phase motion. Complex out-of-phase rotations are numerically found and their stability and bifurcations are defined. It is demonstrated that the emergence of chaotic dynamics happens due to the period doubling bifurcation cascade. The detailed scenario of symmetry breaking is presented. The development of chaotic dynamics leads to the origin of two chaotic attractors of different types. The first one is characterized by the different phases of all pendulums. In the second case, the phases of the two pendulums are equal, and the phase of the third one is different. This regime can be interpreted as a drum-head mode in star-networks.

To this end, we derive the rules of secondary and further bifurcations as a major theoretical contribution of this paper. Then we combine them with pre-existing results of direct bifurcation of the symmetric group [Formula: see text] [Elmhirst, 2004]. Particular attention is devoted to the existence of invariant solutions which retain their spatial distributions when the value of the bifurcation parameter changes. Invariant patterns of an equidistant economy under the replicator dynamics are obtained. The mechanism of bifurcations from these patterns is elucidated. The stability of bifurcating branches is analyzed to demonstrate that most of them are unstable immediately after bifurcation. Numerical analysis of spatial economic models confirms that almost all bifurcating branches are unstable. Direct bifurcating curves connect the curves of invariant solutions, thereby creating a mesh-like network, which appears as threads of warp and weft. The theoretical bifurcation mechanism and numerical examples of networks advanced herein might be of great assistance in the study of spatial economics.", "citations": 5}

While some of the surrounding bifurcations have been previously described, we present the first detailed analytical and numerical description of these states and present analytically and numerically how they are embedded in the bifurcation structure of the system, arising both from the in-phase and the anti-phase solutions, as well as through a saddle-node bifurcation.

The differentiation process consists of a series of symmetry-breaking events, starting from a high-symmetry state (stem cells) to a low-symmetry state (specialized cells). This scenario closely resembles phase transitions in statistical mechanics. To theoretically study this hypothesis, we model embryonic stem cell (ESC) populations through a coupled Boolean network (BN) model. The interaction is applied using a multilayer Ising model that considers paracrine and autocrine signaling, along with external interventions. It is demonstrated that cell-to-cell variability can be interpreted as a mixture of steady-state probability distributions. Simulations have revealed that such models can undergo a series of first- and second-order phase transitions as a function of the system parameters that describe gene expression noise and interaction strengths. These phase transitions result in spontaneous symmetry-breaking events that generate new types of cells characterized by various steady-state distributions. Coupled BNs have also been shown to self-organize in states that allow spontaneous cell differentiation.", "citations": 3}

Here, we develop a model experimental reaction-diffusion network of chemical oscillators to test practical applications of this theory. The network is a symmetric ring of 4 microreactors containing the oscillatory Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction coupled to nearest neighbors via diffusion. Assuming perfect symmetry, theory predicts 4 categories of stable spatiotemporal phase-locked periodic states and 4 categories of invariant manifolds that guide and structure transitions between phase-locked states. In our experiments, we observed the predicted symmetry-derived synchronous clustered transients that occur when the dynamical trajectories coincide with invariant manifolds. However, we observe only 3 of the 4 phase-locked states that are predicted for the idealized homogeneous system. Quantitative agreement between experiment and numerical simulations is found by accounting for the small amount of experimentally determined heterogeneity.

We demonstrate this effect in an ecological multilayer network where the topological asymmetries occur naturally. These asymmetries rescue the system from chaotic oscillations by establishing stable periodic orbits and equilibria. We call this phenomenon asymmetry-induced order and uncover its mechanism by analyzing both analytically and numerically the absence of dynamics on the system's synchronization manifold. Moreover, the bifurcation scenario describing the route from chaos to order is also disclosed. We demonstrate that this result also holds for generic node dynamics by analyzing coupled paradigmatic R\u00f6ssler and Lorenz systems.", "citations": 14}

Symmetry arguments provide a way to study these collective behaviors and to simplify their analysis. The Koopman operator is an infinite dimensional linear operator that fully captures a system's nonlinear dynamics through the linear evolution of functions of the state space. Importantly, in contrast with local linearization, it preserves a system's global nonlinear features. We demonstrate how the presence of symmetries affects the Koopman operator structure and its spectral properties. In fact, we show that symmetry considerations can also simplify finding the Koopman operator approximations using the extended and kernel dynamic mode decomposition methods (EDMD and kernel DMD). Specifically, representation theory allows us to demonstrate that an isotypic component basis induces a block diagonal structure in operator approximations, revealing hidden organization. Practically, if the symmetries are known, the EDMD and kernel DMD methods can be modified to give more efficient computation of the Koopman operator approximation and its eigenvalues, eigenfunctions, and eigenmodes.

The uncoupled resting neurons can be activated by resistive coupling, inducing inhomogeneous resting states (static Smale paradox) and inhomogeneous spikes (dynamic Smale paradox) due to the edge of chaos regime. Considering the single neuron at the periodic spikes or chaotic states, the coupled neurons can mimic shocking oscillation death, non-periodic asynchronization, and periodic synchronization via the Hopf bifurcation theory. From the above analyses, an artificial ring neural network is constructed using 100 memristive neurons and resistive synapses to further study the coupled mechanism, generating exotic spatiotemporal patterns such as chimera death, amplitude chimera, solitary states, and asynchronization because of symmetry breaking. This sheds new light on exploring exotic spatiotemporal patterns of networks based on memristive neurons from the perspective of the nonlinear circuit theory.", "citations": 6}

Moreover, for every synchrony subspace, each network admissible system restricted to that subspace is a dynamical system consistent with a smaller network called a quotient network. We characterize networks such that: the network is a subnetwork of its fundamental network, and the network is a fundamental network. Moreover, we prove that the fundamental network construction preserves the quotient relation and it transforms the subnetwork relation into the quotient relation. The size of cycles in a network and the distance of a cell to a cycle are two important properties concerning the description of the network architecture.

These patterns arise from conserved signaling networks that regulate communication both within and between cells. Here, we develop and present a model-independent ordinary differential equation (ODE) framework for analyzing pattern formation in a homogeneous cell array. In contrast to traditional approaches that focus on specific equations, our method relies solely on general assumptions about global intercellular communication (between cells) and qualitative properties of local intracellular biochemical signaling (within cells). Prior work has shown that global intercellular communication networks alone determine the possible emergent patterns in a generic system. We build on these results by demonstrating that additional constraints on the local intracellular signaling network lead to a single stable pattern which depends on the qualitative features of the network. Our framework enables the prediction of cell fate patterns with minimal modeling assumptions, and provides a powerful tool for inferring unknown interactions within signaling networks by analyzing tissue-level patterns.", "citations": 0}

Our approach builds on existing techniques by combining flow matching with equivariant architectures and an optimal-transport-based coupling mechanism. We generalize equivariant flow matching to a symmetric coupling strategy that aligns predicted and target outputs under group actions, allowing accurate learning in equivariant settings. We validate our approach on a range of systems, from simple conceptual systems to physical problems such as buckling beams and the Allen--Cahn equation.

Moreover, we show that for systems with four coupled phase oscillator populations, there are distinct heteroclinic cycles that form a heteroclinic network. While such networks cannot be asymptotically stable, the local attraction properties of each cycle in the network can be quantified by stability indices. We calculate these stability indices in terms of the coupling parameters between oscillator populations. Hence, our results elucidate how oscillator coupling influences sequential transitions along a heteroclinic network where individual oscillator populations switch sequentially between a high and a low frequency regime; such dynamics appear relevant for the functionality of neural oscillators.", "citations": 23}

It is shown that spurious minima (non-global local minima) do not arise from spontaneous symmetry breaking but rather through a complex deformation of the landscape geometry that can be encoded by a generic S k -equivariant bifurcation.

Much attention has been focused on solutions that are doubly periodic with respect to a square or hexagonal lattice, for which the bifurcation problem can be restricted to a finite-dimensional centre manifold. Previous studies have used four- and six-dimensional representations for the square and hexagonal lattice symmetry groups respectively, which in turn allows the relative stability of squares and rolls or hexagons and rolls to be determined. Here we consider the countably infinite set of eight- and 12-dimensional irreducible representations for the square and hexagonal cases, respectively. This extends earlier relative stability results to include a greater variety of bifurcating planforms, and also allows the stability of rolls, squares and hexagons to be established to a countably infinite set of perturbations. In each case we derive the Taylor expansion of the equivariant bifurcation problem and compute the linear, orbital stability of those solution branches guaranteed to exist by the equivariant branching lemma. In both cases we find that many of the stability results are established at cubic order in the Taylor expansion, although to completely determine the stability of certain states, higher-order terms are required. For the hexagonal lattice, all of the solution branches guaranteed by the equivariant branching lemma are, generically, unstable due to the presence of a quadratic term in the Taylor expansion. For this reason we consider two special cases: the degenerate bifurcation problem that is obtained by setting the coefficient of the quadratic term to zero, and the bifurcation problem when an extra reflection symmetry is present.", "citations": 86}

In minimal flow units commensurate with the intrinsic active vortex scale, we use equivariant bifurcation theory to trace the origin of dynamically relevant ECSs via a sequence of symmetry-constrained local and global bifurcations. At low activity level, we identify relative periodic orbits, created via a sequence of SNIPER, homoclinic and heteroclinic bifurcations, whose invariant manifolds provide robust heteroclinic pathways between left- and right-flowing nearly uniaxial states. These result in several symmetry-dictated reversal mechanisms in the preturbulent regime, with and without vortex-lattice intermediate states. In the active turbulent regime, this ECS skeleton persists and organizes chaotic attractors exhibiting persistent two-way reversals. By classifying ECSs through their symmetry signatures, we relate a small set of ECSs embedded in turbulence back to the preturbulent branches, and show that typical turbulent trajectories repeatedly shadow these ECSs and their unstable manifolds, resulting in near-heteroclinic transitions between opposite-flow states. Our results establish that channel confined active nematic turbulence is organized by a low-dimensional, symmetry-governed network of invariant solutions and their manifolds, and identify dynamical mechanisms that could be exploited to design, promote, or suppress flow reversals in active matter microfluidic devices.", "citations": 0}

Very few general results and techniques are known for the analysis of this problem, though versions of a Maximum Isotropy Subgroup Conjecture have been conjectured, to the effect that generically all solution branches have maximal isotropy (see for example [G, M]). General results of this type are of particular interest for applications on account of the inherent complexity of the structure of isotropy subgroups, invariants and equivariants for ^-representations. In this note, we announce several new results for the general study of the symmetries and branching patterns for a large class of G-equivariant bifurcation problems. In particular, we give new counterexamples to the Maximal Isotropy Subgroup Conjecture and present examples where one can get precise information on the branching patterns.

However, bifurcation theory of neural networks has been developed mostly for mean-field limits of infinite-size spin-glass models, for finite-size dynamical systems whose units have a graded, continuous output, and for models with discrete-output neurons that evolve in continuous time. To allow progress on understanding the dynamics of some widely used classes of neural network models with discrete units and finite size, which could not be studied thoroughly with the previous methodology, here we introduced algorithms that perform a semianalytical bifurcation analysis of a finite-size firing-rate neural network model with binary firing rates and discrete-time evolution. In particular, we focus on the case of small networks composed of tens of neurons, to which existing statistical methods are not applicable. Our approach is based on a numerical brute-force search of the stationary and oscillatory solutions of the model, from which we derive analytical expressions of its bifurcation structure by means of the state-to-state transition probability matrix. Our algorithms determine how the network parameters affect the degree of multistability, the emergence and the period of the neural oscillations, and the formation of spontaneous symmetry breaking in the neural populations. While this technique can be applied to networks with arbitrary (generally asymmetric) connectivity matrices, in particular we introduce a highly efficient algorithm for the bifurcation analysis of sparse networks. We also provide some examples of the obtained bifurcation diagrams and a python implementation of the algorithms.", "citations": 4}

In dimensions [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], a second supercritical pitchfork bifurcation occurs simultaneously for both equilibria originating from the previous one. Furthermore, numerical observations reveal that in dimension [Formula: see text], where [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] is odd, there is a finite cascade of exactly [Formula: see text] subsequent pitchfork bifurcations, whose bifurcation values are independent of [Formula: see text].

Additionally, even though the topological symmetries of a complex network are known, it is still not clear how the system dynamics is transited among different synchronization patterns with respect to the coupling strength of the oscillators. We propose here the framework of eigenvector-based analysis to identify the synchronization patterns in the general complex networks and, incorporating the conventional method of eigenvalue-based analysis, investigate the emergence and transition of the cluster synchronization states. We are able to argue and demonstrate that, without a prior knowledge of the network symmetries, the method is able to predict not only all the cluster synchronization states observable in the network, but also the critical couplings where the states become stable and the sequence of these states in the process of synchronization transition. The efficacy and generality of the proposed method are verified by different network models of coupled chaotic oscillators, including artificial networks of perfect symmetries and empirical networks of non-perfect symmetries. The new framework paves a way to the investigation of synchronization patterns in large-size, general complex networks.", "citations": 11}

Here we address the question whether it is possible to predict gene synchronization from network structure alone. We have recently shown that synchronized gene expression can be predicted from symmetries in the gene regulatory networks described by the concept of symmetry fibrations. We showed that symmetry fibrations partition the genes into groups called fibers based on the symmetries of their \u2019input trees\u2019, the set of paths in the network through which signals can reach a gene. In idealized dynamic gene expression models, all genes in a fiber are perfectly synchronized, while less idealized models\u2014with gene input functions differencing between genes\u2014predict symmetry breaking and desynchronization. To study the functional role of gene fibers and to test whether some of the fiber-induced coexpression remains in reality, we analyze gene fibrations for the gene regulatory networks of E. coli and B. subtilis and confront them with expression data. We find approximate gene coexpression patterns consistent with symmetry fibrations with idealized gene expression dynamics. This shows that network structure alone provides useful information about gene synchronization, and suggest that gene input functions within fibers may be further streamlined by evolutionary pressures to realize a coexpression of genes. Thus, gene fibrations provide a sound conceptual tool to describe tunable coexpression induced by network topology and shaped by mechanistic details of gene expression.", "citations": 16}

This paper addresses the question of the zero set of f near a zero x with isotropy subgroup G. It is known from results of Bierstone and Field on G-transversality theory that the zero set in a neighbourhood of x is a stratified set. The purpose of this paper is to partially determine the structure of the stratified set near x using only information from the representations V and W. We define an index s(\u03a3) for isotropy subgroups \u03a3 of G which is the difference of the dimension of the fixed point subspace of \u03a3 in V and W. Our main result states that if V contains a subspace G-isomorphic to W, then for every maximal isotropy subgroup \u03a3 satisfying s(\u03a3) > s(G), the zero set of f near x contains a smooth manifold of zeros with isotropy subgroup \u03a3 of dimension s(\u03a3). We also present partial results in the case of group representations V and W which do not satisfy the conditions of our main theorem. The paper contains many examples and raises several questions concerning the computation of zero sets of equivariant maps.

This enables us to put the groupoid formalism in a coordinate-free setting and to extend it from ordinary differential equations to vector fields on manifolds. In particular, we construct combinatorial models for categories of modular continuous time dynamical systems.

In this paper we give some persistence results for dynamically invariant sets under perturbations and apply them to coupled populations of phase oscillators with generalized coupling. In contrast to the weak chimeras with nonpositive maximal Lyapunov exponents constructed so far, we show that weak chimeras that are chaotic can exist in the limit of vanishing coupling between coupled populations of phase oscillators.

Here, we study the dynamical aspects of this framework by examining how the requirement of tracking natural data drives the structural and dynamical properties of the agent. We first formalize the notion of generative model using the language of symmetry from group theory, specifically employing Lie pseudogroups to describe the continuous transformations that characterize invariance in natural data. Then, adopting a generic neural network as a proxy for the agent dynamical system and drawing parallels to Noether\u2019s theorem in physics, we demonstrate that data tracking forces the agent to mirror the symmetry properties of the generative world model. This dual constraint on the agent\u2019s constitutive parameters and dynamical repertoire enforces a hierarchical organization consistent with the manifold hypothesis in the neural network. Our findings bridge perspectives from algorithmic information theory (Kolmogorov complexity, compressive modeling), symmetry (group theory), and dynamics (conservation laws, reduced manifolds), offering insights into the neural correlates of agenthood and structured experience in natural systems, as well as the design of artificial intelligence and computational models of the brain. Highlights Lie generative models are formalized using Lie pseudogroups, linking algorithmic simplicity, recursion, and compositionality with symmetry. Neural networks inherit structural constraints reflecting the symmetries in Lie-generated data. Similarly, agents, instantiated as neural networks tracking world Lie-generated data, reflect Lie structure and reduced-dimensional dynamical manifolds. Compositional structure in world data induces coarse-grained constraints, resulting in reduced manifolds that reflect the underlying generative process. Mutual Algorithmic Information (MAI) between the agent and the world emerges as shared symmetries in their dynamical interactions.
