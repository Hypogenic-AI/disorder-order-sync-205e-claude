For instance, heterogeneities may, unexpectedly, lead to enhanced regions of existence of stable synchronization states. This behavior is unexpected because synchronization appears, generically, in symmetric networks with homogeneous components. Related works have, however, misidentified cases where disorder seems to play a critical role in enhancing synchronization, where it is actually not the case. Thus, in order to clarify the role of disorder in adaptive networks, we use normal forms to study, mathematically, when and how the presence of disorder can facilitate the emergence of collective patterns. We employ parameter symmetry breaking to study the interplay between disorder and the underlying bifurcations that determine the conditions for the existence and stability of collective behavior. This work provides a rigorous justification for a certain barycentric condition to be imposed on the heterogeneity of the parameters while studying the synchronization state. Theoretical results are accompanied by numerical simulations, which help clarify incorrect claims of disorder purportedly enhancing synchronization states.", "citations": 0}

The former theory, in particular its specialization to study systems with symmetry, is already well developed and has been used extensively on a wide variety of spatio-temporal systems. There are, however, fewer results on higher-dimensional Hamiltonian systems with symmetry. This lack of results has lead us to investigate the role of symmetry, in particular dihedral symmetry, on high-dimensional coupled Hamiltonian systems. As a representative example, we consider the model equations of a ring of vibratory gyroscopes. The equations are reformulated in a Hamiltonian structure and the corresponding normal forms are derived. Through a normal form analysis, we investigated the effects of various coupling schemes and unraveled the nature of the bifurcations that lead the ring of gyroscopes into and out of synchronization. The Hamiltonian approach is specially useful in investigating the collective behavior of small and large ring sizes and it can be readily extended to other symmetry-related systems.", "citations": 1}

Since the early 1800s, it was realized that precise time-keeping devices having the same stable frequency and precisely synchronized can have important applications in navigation. In modern times, satellite-based global positioning and navigation systems such as the GPS use the same principle. However, even the most sophisticated satellite navigation equipment cannot operate in every environment. In response to this need, we present a computational and analytical study of a network-based model of a high-precision, inexpensive, coupled crystal oscillator system and timing (CCOST) device. A bifurcation analysis (carried out by the authors in a related publication) [Buono et al., SIAM J. Appl. Dyn. Syst. 17, 1310 (2018)1536-004010.1137/16M1066154] of the network dynamics shows a wide variety of collective patterns, mainly various forms of discrete rotating waves and synchronization patterns. Results from computer simulations seem to indicate that, among all patterns, the standard traveling wave pattern in which consecutive crystals oscillate out of phase by 2\u03c0/N, where N is the network size, leads to phase drift error that decreases as 1/N as opposed to 1/sqrt[N] for an uncoupled ensemble. The results should provide guidelines for future experiments, design, and fabrication tasks.", "citations": 6}
