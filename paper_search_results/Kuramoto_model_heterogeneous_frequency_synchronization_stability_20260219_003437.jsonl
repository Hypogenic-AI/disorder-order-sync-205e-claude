Our key insight is to exploit the relationship between the power network model and a first-order model of coupled oscillators. Assuming overdamped generators (possibly due to local excitation controllers), a singular perturbation analysis shows the equivalence between the classic swing equations and a non-uniform Kuramoto model characterized by multiple time constants, non-homogeneous coupling, and non-uniform phase shifts. By extending methods from synchronization theory and consensus protocols, we establish sufficient conditions for synchronization of non-uniform Kuramoto oscillators. These conditions reduce to and improve upon previously-available tests for the classic Kuramoto model. By combining our singular perturbation and Kuramoto analyses, we derive concise and purely algebraic conditions that relate synchronization and transient stability of a power network to the underlying network parameters and initial conditions.", "citations": 819}

It is well-known that there exists a critical coupling strength among the oscillators at which a phase transition from incoherency to synchronization occurs. This paper features four contributions. First, we characterize and distinguish the different notions of synchronization used throughout the literature and formally introduce the concept of phase cohesiveness as an analysis tool and performance index for synchronization. Second, we review the vast literature providing necessary, sufficient, implicit, and explicit estimates of the critical coupling strength for finite and infinite-dimensional, and for first and second-order Kuramoto models. Third, we present the first explicit necessary and sufficient condition on the critical coupling to achieve synchronization in the finite-dimensional Kuramoto model for an arbitrary distribution of the natural frequencies. The multiplicative gap in the synchronization condition yields a practical stability result determining the admissible initial and the guaranteed ultimate phase cohesiveness as well as the guaranteed asymptotic magnitude of the order parameter. Fourth and finally, we extend our analysis to multi-rate Kuramoto models consisting of second-order Kuramoto oscillators with inertia and viscous damping together with first-order Kuramoto oscillators with multiple time constants. We prove that the multi-rate Kuramoto model is locally topologically conjugate to a first-order Kuramoto model with scaled natural frequencies, and we present necessary and sufficient conditions for almost global phase synchronization and local frequency synchronization. Interestingly, these conditions do not depend on the inertiae which contradicts prior observations on the role of inertiae in synchronization of second-order Kuramoto models.", "citations": 343}

Nevertheless, many questions have remained open, especially about the possibility of global bifurcations. Here we derive the system's stability diagram for the special case where the bimodal distribution consists of two equally weighted Lorentzians. Using an ansatz recently discovered by Ott and Antonsen, we show that in this case the infinite-dimensional problem reduces exactly to a flow in four dimensions. Depending on the parameters and initial conditions, the long-term dynamics evolves to one of three states: incoherence, where all the oscillators are desynchronized; partial synchrony, where a macroscopic group of phase-locked oscillators coexists with a sea of desynchronized ones; and a standing wave state, where two counter-rotating groups of phase-locked oscillators emerge. Analytical results are presented for the bifurcation boundaries between these states.

The Kuramoto model was motivated by this phenomenon of collective synchronization, when a group of a large number of oscillators spontaneously lock to a common frequency, despite vast differences in their individual frequencies. Inspired by Kuramoto's groundbreaking work in the 1970s, this model captures the essence of how interconnected systems, ranging from biological networks to power grids, can achieve a state of synchronization.

In case the coupling strength is strong, a sufficient condition of synchronization is established for general $N\\geqslant 2$. On the other hand, we analyze the case when the coupling strength is weak. For $N=2$, when coupling strength is weak (below the critical coupling strength $\\lambda_c$), we show that new periodic orbits emerge near each equilibrium point, and hence phase-locking state exists. This phenomenon is different from the real Kuramoto system since it is impossible to arrive at any synchronization when $\\lambda<\\lambda_c$. We prove a theorem that states a set of closed and dense contour forms near each equilibrium point, resembling a tree's growth rings. In other words, the trajectory of phase difference lies on a $4D$-torus surface. Therefore, this implies that the phase-locking state is Lyapunov stable but not asymptotically stable. The proof uses a new infinite buffer method (``$\\delta/n$ criterion\") and a Lyapunov function argument. This has been studied both analytically and numerically. For $N=3$, we consider the ``Lion Dance flow\", the analog of Cherry flow for our model, to demonstrate that the quaternionic synchronization exists even when the coupling strength is ``super weak\"(when $\\lambda/\\omega<0.85218915...$).

We test the theory against experimental results and circuit-level simulations in a prototype system of mutually delay-coupled electronic clocks, so-called phase-locked loops. Interestingly, our results show that heterogeneity in the system can actually enhance the stability of synchronized states. That means that beyond the optimizations that can be achieved by tuning homogeneous coupling strengths, time delays, and loop-filter cut-off frequencies, heterogeneities in these system parameters enable much better optimization of perturbation decay rates, stabilization of synchronous states, and tuning of phase differences between the clocks.

The master solution embodies all particular solutions of the finite-size Kuramoto model for any frequency distribution and coupling strength larger than the critical one. Furthermore, we present a criterion to determine the stability of the FS solution.

Through a qualitative bifurcation analysis of the auxiliary system, we derive explicit bounds that relate the maximum natural frequency mismatch, inertia, and the network size that can support stable partial synchronization.

For sufficiently large inertia, the system reveals the coexistence of a PS state and of a standing wave (SW) solution. In the bimodal case, the hysteretic synchronization transition involves several states. Namely, the system becomes coherent passing through traveling waves (TWs), SWs and finally arriving to a PS regime. The transition to the PS state from the SW occurs always at the same coupling, independently of the system size, while its value increases linearly with the inertia. On the other hand the critical coupling required to observe TWs and SWs increases with N suggesting that in the thermodynamic limit the transition from incoherence to PS will occur without any intermediate states. Finally a linear stability analysis reveals that the system is hysteretic not only at the level of macroscopic indicators, but also microscopically as verified by measuring the maximal Lyapunov exponent.", "citations": 9}

In this article, we study the synchronization behaviors of the Kuramoto model with a pure competition coupling function. Namely, instead of the sine function, we choose $\\max \\{0, \\sin \\theta \\}$ to be the coupling function. This indicates the relation of pure competition between oscillators. We prove asymptotical phase synchronization for identical oscillators and asymptotical frequency synchronization for non-identical oscillators under reasonable sufficient conditions. In particular, under our sufficient conditions, the synchronized frequency is the maximal frequency of all the natural frequencies. On the other hand, in the parameter regime which is out of the scope of the analysis of our theorems, it is possible that the synchronized frequency could be larger than the maximal frequency of the natural frequencies of all the oscillators.

The population is described by a Fokker-Planck equation for the distribution of phases, and we apply center-manifold reduction to obtain the amplitude equations for steady-state and Hopf bifurcation from the equilibrium state with a uniform phase distribution. When the population is described by a native frequency distribution that is reflection-symmetric about zero, the problem has circular symmetry. In the limit of zero extrinsic noise, although the critical eigenvalues are embedded in the continuous spectrum, the nonlinear coefficients in the amplitude equation remain finite, in contrast to the singular behavior found in similar instabilities described by the Vlasov-Poisson equation. For a bimodal reflection-symmetric distribution, both types of bifurcation are possible and they coincide at a codimension-two Takens-Bogdanov point. The steady-state bifurcation may be supercritical or subcritical and produces a time-independent synchronized state. The Hopf bifurcation produces both supercritical stable standing waves and supercritical unstable traveling waves. Previous work on the Hopf bifurcation in a bimodal population by Bonilla, Neu, and Spigler and by Okuda and Kuramoto predicted stable traveling waves and stable standing waves, respectively. A comparison to these previous calculations shows that the prediction of stable traveling waves results from a failure to include all unstable modes.", "citations": 162}

Central to this objective-UQ is the concept of mean objective cost of uncertainty (MOCU), which provides effective means of quantifying the impact of uncertainty on the operational goals at hand. MOCU is especially useful for optimal experimental design (OED) as the potential efficacy of an experimental (or data acquisition) campaign can be quantified by estimating the MOCU that is expected to remain after the campaign. However, MOCU-based OED tends to be computationally expensive, which limits its practical applicability. In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning (ML) scheme that can significantly accelerate MOCU computation and expedite MOCU-based experimental design. The main idea is to use an ML model to efficiently search for the optimal robust operator under model uncertainty, a necessary step for computing MOCU. We apply the proposed ML-based OED acceleration scheme to design experiments aimed at optimally enhancing the control performance of uncertain Kuramoto oscillator models.

For instance, inertial effects may destabilize incoherence, giving rise to bifurcating synchronized standing wave states.

We study how network modifications affect the synchronization properties of network-coupled dynamical systems that have heterogeneous node dynamics (e.g., phase oscillators with non-identical frequencies), which is often the case for real-world systems. Our approach relies on a synchrony alignment function (SAF) that quantifies the interplay between heterogeneity of the network and of the oscillators and provides an objective measure for a system's ability to synchronize. We conduct a spectral perturbation analysis of the SAF for structural network modifications including the addition and removal of edges, which subsequently ranks the edges according to their importance to synchronization.

The usual formulation in the form of a system of coupled ordinary differential equations is not always adequate. We present a new energy-based formulation of the Kuramoto model with inertia as a polynomial port-Hamiltonian system of differential-algebraic equations, with a quadratic Hamiltonian function including a generalized order parameter. This leads to a robust representation of the system with respect to disturbances: it encodes the underlying physics, such as the dissipation inequality or the deviation from synchronicity, directly in the structure of the equations, and it explicitly displays all possible constraints and allows for robust simulation methods.

In this paper we present two related results. Firstly, we derive an analytical criteria that, for sufficiently strong coupling, guarantees the existence of a partially phase-locked state by proving the existence of an attracting ball around a fixed point of a subset of the oscillators. We also derive a larger invariant ball such that any point in it will asymptotically converge to the attracting ball. Secondly, we consider the large N behavior of the finite N Kuramoto system with randomly distributed frequencies. In the case where the frequencies are independent and identically distributed we use a result of De Smet and Aeyels on partial entrainment to derive a condition giving (with high probability) the existence of a partially entrained cluster.

We illustrate this methodology with the classic Kuramoto phase oscillator model, and demonstrate how our manifold learning technique can successfully identify a coarse variable that is one-to-one with the established Kuramoto order parameter. We then introduce an extension of our coarse-graining methodology which enables us to learn evolution equations for the discovered coarse variables via an artificial neural network architecture templated on numerical time integrators (initial value solvers). This approach allows us to learn accurate approximations of time derivatives of state variables from sparse flow data, and hence discover useful approximate differential equation descriptions of their dynamic behavior. We demonstrate this capability by learning ODEs that agree with the known analytical expression for the Kuramoto order parameter dynamics at the continuum limit. We then show how this approach can also be used to learn the dynamics of coarse variables discovered through our manifold learning methodology. In both of these examples, we compare the results of our neural network based method to typical finite differences complemented with geometric harmonics. Finally, we present a series of computational examples illustrating how a variation of our manifold learning methodology can be used to discover sets of \u201ceffective\u201d parameters, reduced parameter combinations, for multi-parameter models with complex coupling. We conclude with a discussion of possible extensions of this approach, including the possibility of obtaining data-driven effective partial differential equations for coarse-grained neuronal network behavior, as illustrated by the synchronization dynamics of Hodgkin\u2013Huxley type neurons with a Chung-Lu network. Thus, we build an integrated suite of tools for obtaining data-driven coarse variables, data-driven effective parameters, and data-driven coarse-grained equations from detailed observations of networks of oscillators.", "citations": 26}

For this purpose, we define the utility function which expresses the QoS of a user and synchronize this utility function value of each user for fair resource allocation. The synchronization of the utility function is obtained by Kuramoto model and coupling coefficient defined in Kuramoto model is dynamically adjusted for faster convergence. The range of convergence of the Kuramoto model is derived analytically. From the simulation results, we can verify that the performance of the proposed algorithm is better than those of the existing algorithms with regard to QoS fairness, power, and data rate.

Characterizing the structure of these basins is, in general, a complicated task, especially in high dimensionality. Recent works have advocated to quantify the non-linear stability of fixed points of dynamical systems through the relative volumes of the associated basins of attraction [Wiley et al., Chaos 16, 015103 (2006) and Menck et al. Nat. Phys. 9, 89 (2013)]. Here, we revisit this issue and propose an efficient numerical method to estimate these volumes. The algorithm first identifies stable fixed points. Second, a set of initial conditions is considered that are randomly distributed at the surface of hypercubes centered on each fixed point. These initial conditions are dynamically evolved. The linear size of each basin of attraction is finally determined by the proportion of initial conditions which converge back to the fixed point. Armed with this algorithm, we revisit the problem considered by Wiley et al. in a seminal paper [Chaos 16, 015103 (2006)] that inspired the title of the present manuscript and consider the equal-frequency Kuramoto model on a cycle. Fixed points of this model are characterized by an integer winding number q and the number n of oscillators. We find that the basin volumes scale as (1-4q/n)n, contrasting with the Gaussian behavior postulated in the study by Wiley et al.. Finally, we show the applicability of our method to complex models of coupled oscillators with different natural frequencies and on meshed networks.", "citations": 46}

For positive values of the coupling strength, at which the incoherence turns out to be unstable, a self-consistency approach is developed to theoretically predict the degree of global coherence of the model.

By adopting an adaptive coupling, new phenomena of phase transitions are observed. Specifically, for nodal dynamics of odd dimensions, a double discontinuous synchronization transition is observed, whereas for the Kuramoto model defined on links, a single discontinuous synchronization transition occurs. Rigorous theoretical analysis reveals that the double discontinuous transition originates from the loss of stability of the incoherent state and a saddle-node bifurcation in the parameter space. Furthermore, for the D-dimensional Kuramoto model defined on links with D>2, synchronization is unattainable because of the inability to project dynamics onto adjacent dimensional simplices.

While there are numerous well-known order parameters to characterize these dynamics, shortcoming of these metrics are also recognized. To capture all transitions from phase disordered states over phase locking to fully synchronized systems, new metrics were proposed and demonstrated on homogeneous models. In this paper, we aim to address a gap in the literature, namely, to examine how the gradual improvement of power grid models affects the goodness of certain metrics. To study how the details of models are perceived by the different metrics, 12 variations of a power grid model were created, introducing varying levels of heterogeneity through the coupling strength, the nodal powers, and the moment of inertia. The grid models were compared using a second-order Kuramoto equation and adaptive Runge-Kutta solver, measuring the values of the phase, the frequency, and the universal order parameters. Finally, frequency results of the models were compared to grid measurements. We found that the universal order parameter was able to capture more details of the grid models, especially in cases of decreasing moment of inertia. Even the most heterogeneous models showed notable synchronization, encouraging the use of such models. Finally, we show local frequency results related to the multi-peaks of static models, which implies that spatial heterogeneity can also induce such multi-peak behavior.", "citations": 4}

This property guarantees that all trajectories of the Kuramoto model converge to a fully synchronized state except for a measure-zero set of initial conditions, a phenomenon known as global synchronization. Existing guarantees typically require that each node be connected to a sufficiently large fraction of the other nodes, enforcing high graph density. In this work, we show that threshold graphs lie well outside this regime while still exhibiting global synchronization.

We provide a sufficient condition for the emergence of asymptotical synchronization if the initial data are confined in half circle. As lack of uniform coercivity in general digraph, we apply the node decomposition criteria in [25] to capture a clear hierarchical structure, which successfully yields the dissipation mechanism of phase diameter and an invariant set confined in quarter circle after some finite time. Then the dissipation of frequency diameter will be clear, which eventually leads to the synchronization.", "citations": 3}

Santos", "url": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/69c4fa370ac731807f4026f0d879dee30adb835a", "relevance": 1, "abstract": "This work presents a pedagogical approach for introducing synchronization phenomena in high school physics education through the Kuramoto model, contributing to complex systems education at the secondary level. Synchronization occurs when coupled oscillators, initially out of phase, begin to oscillate in phase with a common frequency due to coupling between their constituent elements. This phenomenon is widely observed in nature and artificial systems, from firefly flashing patterns to mechanical metronomes, yet remains largely absent from secondary education curricula. We propose a two-stage methodology to make this complex concept accessible to high school students. The first stage involves experimental investigation using video analysis with Tracker software to study coupled metronomes, allowing students to observe phase relationships and measure synchronization dynamics. The second stage utilizes computational simulations to explore the mathematical framework of the Kuramoto model and examine various coupling scenarios. This approach bridges the gap between advanced physics concepts typically reserved for university-level courses and secondary education, enabling educators to effectively teach sophisticated phenomena from complex systems at the high school level. The methodology integrates theoretical understanding with hands-on experimentation and computational modelling, providing students with multiple perspectives on synchronization phenomena.", "citations": 0}

Many of these applications seek phase-coherent solutions, i.e., equilibria of the model. Historically, research has focused on situations where the number of oscillators, $n$, is extremely large and can be treated as being infinite. More recently, however, applications have arisen in areas such as electrical engineering with more modest values of $n$. For these, the equilibria can be located by finding the real solutions of a system of polynomial equations utilizing techniques from algebraic geometry. However, typical methods for solving such systems locate all complex solutions even though only the real solutions give equilibria. In this paper, we present an algorithm to locate only the real solutions of the model, thereby shortening computation time by several orders of magnitude in certain situations. This is accomplished by choosing specific equilibria representatives and the consequent algebraic decoupling of the system. The correctness of the algorithm (that it finds only and all the equilibria) is proved rigorously. Additionally, the algorithm can be implemented using interval methods so that the equilibria can be approximated up to any given precision without significantly more computational effort. We also compare this solving approach to other computational algebraic geometric methods. Furthermore, analyzing this approach allows us to prove, asymptotically, that the maximum number of equilibria grows at the same rate as the number of complex solutions of a corresponding polynomial system. Finally, we conjecture an upper bound on the maximum number of equilibria for any number of oscillators which generalizes the known cases and is obtained on a range of explicitly provided natural frequencies.", "citations": 24}

We compare regular 405 and 1004 lattice results with those of 12,0002 lattice substrates with power-law decaying long links (ll). The latter heterogeneous network exhibits ds>4 spectral dimensions. We show strong corrections to scaling and mean-field type of criticality at d=5, with logarithmic corrections at d=4 Euclidean dimensions. Contrarily, the ll model exhibits a non-mean-field smeared transition, with oscillating corrections at similarly high spectral dimensions. This suggests that the network heterogeneity is relevant, causing frustrated synchronization akin to Griffiths effects.", "citations": 2}

Such chimera-type patterns with an incoherent state formed by a single oscillator were observed in various oscillator networks; however, there is still a lack of understanding of how such states can stably appear. Here, we study the stability of solitary states in Kuramoto networks of identical two-dimensional phase oscillators with inertia and a phase-lagged coupling. The presence of inertia can induce rotatory dynamics of the phase difference between the solitary oscillator and the coherent cluster. We derive asymptotic stability conditions for such a solitary state as a function of inertia, network size, and phase lag that may yield either attractive or repulsive coupling. Counterintuitively, our analysis demonstrates that (1) increasing the size of the coherent cluster can promote the stability of the solitary state in the attractive coupling case and (2) the solitary state can be stable in small-size networks with all repulsive coupling. We also discuss the implications of our stability analysis for the emergence of rotatory chimeras.", "citations": 8}

Utilizing the Kuramoto model, we examine the effects of delayed coupling on collective dynamics. Our analytical and numerical results reveal distinct synchronization behaviors across various time delay regimes, including fully synchronized states, helical patterns, dynamically incoherent states, and random phase-locked states. We identify the regime in which time delay inhibits synchrony, which aligns with theoretical predictions derived from stability analysis. In the region between the synchrony-possible and synchrony-forbidden zones, a coexistence of synchronized and unsynchronized dynamics is observed, referred to as chimera states. We ascertain that the type of chimera states present is moving turbulent.", "citations": 1}
