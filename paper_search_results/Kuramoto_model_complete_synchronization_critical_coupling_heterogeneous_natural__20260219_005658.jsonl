For the analysis of emergent asymptotic patterns in the Kuramoto flow, we introduce the pathwise critical coupling strength which yields a sharp transition from partial phase-locking to complete phase-locking, and provide nontrivial upper bounds for the pathwise critical coupling strength. Numerical simulations suggest that multi- and mono-clusters can emerge asymptotically in the Kuramoto flow depending on the relative magnitude of the coupling strength compared to the sizes of natural frequencies. However, theoretical and rigorous analysis for such phase-locking dynamics of the Kuramoto flow still lacks a complete understanding, although there were some recent progress on the complete synchronization of the Kuramoto model in a sufficiently large coupling strength regime (D\u00f6rfler and Bullo in SIAM J Appl Dyn Syst 10:1070\u20131099, 2011, Automatica 50:1539\u20131564, 2014; Ha et al. in Commun Math Sci 4:1073\u20131091, 2016). In this paper, we present sufficient frameworks for partial phase-locking of a majority ensemble and the complete phase-locking in terms of the initial phase configuration, coupling strength and natural frequencies. As a by-product of our analysis, we obtain nontrivial upper bounds for the pathwise critical coupling strength in terms of the diameter of natural frequencies, initial Kuramoto order parameter and the system size N.

It is well-known that there exists a critical coupling strength among the oscillators at which a phase transition from incoherency to synchronization occurs. This paper features four contributions. First, we characterize and distinguish the different notions of synchronization used throughout the literature and formally introduce the concept of phase cohesiveness as an analysis tool and performance index for synchronization. Second, we review the vast literature providing necessary, sufficient, implicit, and explicit estimates of the critical coupling strength for finite and infinite-dimensional, and for first and second-order Kuramoto models. Third, we present the first explicit necessary and sufficient condition on the critical coupling to achieve synchronization in the finite-dimensional Kuramoto model for an arbitrary distribution of the natural frequencies. The multiplicative gap in the synchronization condition yields a practical stability result determining the admissible initial and the guaranteed ultimate phase cohesiveness as well as the guaranteed asymptotic magnitude of the order parameter. Fourth and finally, we extend our analysis to multi-rate Kuramoto models consisting of second-order Kuramoto oscillators with inertia and viscous damping together with first-order Kuramoto oscillators with multiple time constants. We prove that the multi-rate Kuramoto model is locally topologically conjugate to a first-order Kuramoto model with scaled natural frequencies, and we present necessary and sufficient conditions for almost global phase synchronization and local frequency synchronization. Interestingly, these conditions do not depend on the inertiae which contradicts prior observations on the role of inertiae in synchronization of second-order Kuramoto models.", "citations": 343}

There are twenty four permutations upon assigning the initial frequencies to the oscillators. The local interaction between the adjacent coupled phase oscillators introduces details to the synchronization features. Therefore, for the four unalike local coupled oscillators, we classify all possible arrangements into three classes, where each class contains eight configurations. The synchronized state appears at the distinctive coupling when the oscillators transit to synchrony having noticeable characteristics for each class. Also, the unison behaviour emerges when a well-defined phase condition is developed. We utilize this conspicuous phase condition to obtain a mathematical expression predicting the distinguishing coupling for each class once the oscillators have a common frequency. The obtained expression is given in terms of the initial frequencies, at the minute the four local coupled phase oscillators attain the same frequency. The analytic formula of the critical coupling allows us to obtain expressions usable to determine the phase differences at the swop into a synchronization stage.", "citations": 0}

Synchronization is enhanced when nodes are surrounded by nodes of the opposite frequency. The theoretical result presented in this paper is an analytical estimation for the minimum value of the coupling strength between oscillators that guarantees the achievement of a globally synchronized state.

It allows one to solve explicitly for the synchronization order parameter and the critical point of (1) the full phase-locking transition for a system with a finite number of oscillators (unlike the original Kuramoto model, which is solvable implicitly only in the mean-field limit) and (2) a new class of continuum systems.

This natural tendency towards dynamical consensus has spurred a large body of theoretical and experimental research in recent decades. The Kuramoto model constitutes the most studied and paradigmatic framework in which to study synchronization. In particular, it shows how synchronization appears as a phase transition from a dynamically disordered state at some critical value for the coupling strength between the interacting units. The critical properties of the synchronization transition of this model have been widely studied and many variants of its formulations have been considered to address different physical realizations. However, the Kuramoto model has been studied only within the domain of classical dynamics, thus neglecting its applications for the study of quantum synchronization phenomena. Based on a system-bath approach and within the Feynman path-integral formalism, we derive equations for the Kuramoto model by taking into account the first quantum fluctuations. We also analyze its critical properties, the main result being the derivation of the value for the synchronization onset. This critical coupling increases its value as quantumness increases, as a consequence of the possibility of tunneling that quantum fluctuations provide.", "citations": 34}

In this paper, a bifurcation structure of the infinite-dimensional Kuramoto model is investigated. A purpose here is to prove the bifurcation diagram of the model conjectured by Kuramoto in 1984; if the coupling strength $K$ between oscillators, which is a parameter of the system, is smaller than some threshold ${K}_{c} $, the de-synchronous state (trivial steady state) is asymptotically stable, while if $K$ exceeds ${K}_{c} $, a non-trivial stable solution, which corresponds to the synchronization, bifurcates from the de-synchronous state. One of the difficulties in proving the conjecture is that a certain non-selfadjoint linear operator, which defines a linear part of the Kuramoto model, has the continuous spectrum on the imaginary axis. Hence, the standard spectral theory is not applicable to prove a bifurcation as well as the asymptotic stability of the steady state. In this paper, the spectral theory on a space of generalized functions is developed with the aid of a rigged Hilbert space to avoid the continuous spectrum on the imaginary axis. Although the linear operator has an unbounded continuous spectrum on a Hilbert space, it is shown that it admits a spectral decomposition consisting of a countable number of eigenfunctions on a space of generalized functions. The semigroup generated by the linear operator will be estimated with the aid of the spectral theory on a rigged Hilbert space to prove the linear stability of the steady state of the system. The center manifold theory is also developed on a space of generalized functions. It is proved that there exists a finite-dimensional center manifold on a space of generalized functions, while a center manifold on a Hilbert space is of infinite dimension because of the continuous spectrum on the imaginary axis. These results are applied to the stability and bifurcation theory of the Kuramoto model to obtain a bifurcation diagram conjectured by Kuramoto.", "citations": 99}

The Kuramoto theory for the transition to synchronization can be explicitly generalized, such as the expression for the critical coupling strength. Also, a self-consistency approach is developed to predict the stationary states in the thermodynamic limit. Moreover, Landau damping effects are further revealed by means of linear stability analysis and resonance poles theory below the critical threshold, which turns to be far more generic. Our theoretical analysis and numerical results are consistent with each other, which can help us understand the synchronization transition in general networks with heterogenous couplings.", "citations": 20}

It was widely known that the system experiences a continuous (second-order) phase transition to synchronization by gradually increasing the homogeneous coupling among the oscillators. As the interest in exploring synchronized dynamics continues to grow, the heterogeneous patterns between phase oscillators have received ample attention during the past years. Here, we consider a variant of the Kuramoto model with quenched disorder in their natural frequencies and coupling. Correlating these two types of heterogeneity via a generic weighted function, we systematically investigate the impacts of the heterogeneous strategies, the correlation function, and the natural frequency distribution on the emergent dynamics. Importantly, we develop an analytical treatment for capturing the essential dynamical properties of the equilibrium states. In particular, we uncover that the critical threshold corresponding to the onset of synchronization is unaffected by the location of the inhomogeneity, which, however, does depend crucially on the value of the correlation function at its center. Furthermore, we reveal that the relaxation dynamics of the incoherent state featuring the responses to external perturbations is significantly shaped by all the considered effects, thereby leading to various decaying mechanisms of the order parameters in the subcritical region. Moreover, we untangle that synchronization is facilitated by the out-coupling strategy in the supercritical region. Our study is a step forward in highlighting the potential importance of the inhomogeneous patterns involved in the complex systems, and could thus provide theoretical insights for profoundly understanding the generic statistical mechanical properties of the steady states toward synchronization.", "citations": 0}

Thus, there is great interest in analyzing phase transitions to large-scale connectivity and to global synchronization, including how to enhance or delay the onset. These phenomena are traditionally studied as second-order phase transitions where, at the critical threshold, the order parameter increases rapidly but continuously. In 2009, an extremely abrupt transition was found for a network growth process where links compete for addition in an attempt to delay percolation. This observation of \u2018explosive percolation\u2019 was ultimately revealed to be a continuous transition in the thermodynamic limit, yet with very atypical finite-size scaling, and it started a surge of work on explosive phenomena and their consequences. Many related models are now shown to yield discontinuous percolation transitions and even hybrid transitions. Explosive percolation enables many other features such as multiple giant components, modular structures, discrete scale invariance and non-self-averaging, relating to properties found in many real phenomena such as explosive epidemics, electric breakdowns and the emergence of molecular life. Models of explosive synchronization provide an analytic framework for the dynamics of abrupt transitions and reveal the interplay between the distribution in natural frequencies and the network structure, with applications ranging from epileptic seizures to waking from anesthesia.

INTRODUCTION Synchronization, as an emerging phenomenon of a pop- ulation of dynamically interacting units, has fascinated humans from ancestral times. No matter whether the phenomenon is spontaneous or induced, synchronization captivates our minds and becomes one of the most in- teresting scienti\ufb01c problems. Synchronization processes are ubiquitous in nature and play a very important role in many di\ufb00erent contexts as biology, ecology, climatol- ogy, sociology, technology, or even in arts ((Osipov et al., 2007; Pikovsky et al., 2001).

We first observe that there are solutions exhibiting finite-time blow-up behavior in all coupling regimes. When the coupling strength \u03bb>\u03bbc, sufficient conditions for various types of synchronization are established for general N\u2a7e2. On the other hand, we analyse the case when the coupling strength is weak. For N\u2009=\u20092 with coupling below \u03bbc, our complex-analytic approach not only recovers the periodic orbits reported by Th\u00fcmler\u2013Srinivas\u2013Schr\u00f6der\u2013Timme but also provides, for the first time, their exact period T\u03c9,\u03bb=2\u03c0/\u03c92\u2212\u03bb2, confirming full phase locking. Furthermore, for the critical case \u03bb=\u03bbc, we find that the complexified Kuramoto system admits homoclinic orbits. These phenomena significantly differentiate the complexified Kuramoto model from the real Kuramoto system, as synchronization never occurs when \u03bb<\u03bbc in the latter. For N\u2009=\u20093, we demonstrate that if the natural frequencies are in arithmetic progression, non-trivial synchronization states can be achieved for certain initial conditions even when the coupling strength is weak. In particular, we characterize the critical coupling strength ( \u03bb/\u03bbc=0.85218915\u2026) such that a semistable equilibrium point in the real Kuramoto model bifurcates into a pair of stable and unstable equilibria, marking a new phenomenon in complexified Kuramoto models.", "citations": 2}

Accordingly, the most well-adopted choice of the coupling function is the sine function. Due to the oddness of the sine function, the synchronized frequency would be the average of all the natural frequencies. In this article, we study the synchronization behaviors of the Kuramoto model with a pure competition coupling function. Namely, instead of the sine function, we choose $\\max \\{0, \\sin \\theta \\}$ to be the coupling function. This indicates the relation of pure competition between oscillators. We prove asymptotical phase synchronization for identical oscillators and asymptotical frequency synchronization for non-identical oscillators under reasonable sufficient conditions. In particular, under our sufficient conditions, the synchronized frequency is the maximal frequency of all the natural frequencies. On the other hand, in the parameter regime which is out of the scope of the analysis of our theorems, it is possible that the synchronized frequency could be larger than the maximal frequency of the natural frequencies of all the oscillators. In this article, we also provide numerical experiments to support the analysis of our theorem and to demonstrate the aforementioned phenomenon.", "citations": 0}

In 1984 Kuramoto proposed several conjectures about its behavior; ten years later, Crawford obtained the first analytical results by means of a local center manifold calculation. Nevertheless, many questions have remained open, especially about the possibility of global bifurcations. Here we derive the system's stability diagram for the special case where the bimodal distribution consists of two equally weighted Lorentzians. Using an ansatz recently discovered by Ott and Antonsen, we show that in this case the infinite-dimensional problem reduces exactly to a flow in four dimensions. Depending on the parameters and initial conditions, the long-term dynamics evolves to one of three states: incoherence, where all the oscillators are desynchronized; partial synchrony, where a macroscopic group of phase-locked oscillators coexists with a sea of desynchronized ones; and a standing wave state, where two counter-rotating groups of phase-locked oscillators emerge. Analytical results are presented for the bifurcation boundaries between these states. Similar results are also obtained for the case in which the bimodal distribution is given by the sum of two Gaussians.", "citations": 264}

In general, critical systems are associated with fractal or power law scaling, long-range correlations in space and time, and rapid reconfiguration in response to external inputs. Here, we consider two measures of phase synchronization: the phase-lock interval, or duration of coupling between a pair of (neurophysiological) processes, and the lability of global synchronization of a (brain functional) network. Using computational simulations of two mechanistically distinct systems displaying complex dynamics, the Ising model and the Kuramoto model, we show that both synchronization metrics have power law probability distributions specifically when these systems are in a critical state. We then demonstrate power law scaling of both pairwise and global synchronization metrics in functional MRI and magnetoencephalographic data recorded from normal volunteers under resting conditions. These results strongly suggest that human brain functional systems exist in an endogenous state of dynamical criticality, characterized by a greater than random probability of both prolonged periods of phase-locking and occurrence of large rapid changes in the state of global synchronization, analogous to the neuronal \u201cavalanches\u201d previously described in cellular systems. Moreover, evidence for critical dynamics was identified consistently in neurophysiological systems operating at frequency intervals ranging from 0.05\u20130.11 to 62.5\u2013125 Hz, confirming that criticality is a property of human brain functional network organization at all frequency intervals in the brain's physiological bandwidth.", "citations": 542}

Specifically, we identify the critical values of the coupling strength (transition points), between which the incoherent state is linearly stable and is unstable otherwise. We show that the transition points depend on the largest positive or/and smallest negative eigenvalue(s) of the kernel operator defined by the graph limit. This reveals the precise mechanism, by which the network topology controls transition to synchrony in the Kuramoto model on graphs.

In the limiting case g(Omega)=delta(Omega), the critical coupling becomes independent of inertia. A richer phenomenology is found for bimodal distributions. For instance, inertial effects may destabilize incoherence, giving rise to bifurcating synchronized standing wave states. Inertia tends to harden the bifurcation from incoherence to synchronized states: at zero inertia, this bifurcation is supercritical (soft), but it tends to become subcritical (hard) as inertia increases. Nonlinear stability is investigated in the limit of high natural frequencies.", "citations": 81}

Recently, however, explosive phenomena have been reported in complex networks\u2019 structure and dynamics, which rather remind first-order (discontinuous and irreversible) transitions. Explosive percolation, which was discovered in 2009, corresponds to an abrupt change in the network\u2019s structure, and explosive synchronization (which is concerned, instead, with the abrupt emergence of a collective state in the networks\u2019 dynamics) was studied as early as the first models of globally coupled phase oscillators were taken into consideration. The two phenomena have stimulated investigations and debates, attracting attention in many relevant fields. So far, various substantial contributions and progresses (including experimental verifications) have been made, which have provided insights on what structural and dynamical properties are needed for inducing such abrupt transformations, as well as have greatly enhanced our understanding of phase transitions in networked systems.

Under the view of coupled oscillators, we first show the connection between Kuramoto model and basic GNN and then over-smoothing phenomenon in GNNs can be interpreted as phase synchronization in Kuramoto model.

Here, by reset is meant a reinitialization of the dynamics from a given state. We pursue our investigation within the ambit of the well-known Kuramoto model of coupled phase-only oscillators of distributed natural frequencies. Here, the reset protocol corresponds to a chosen set of oscillators being reset to a synchronized state at random times. We find that the mean \u03c9_{0} of the natural frequencies plays a defining role in determining the long-time state of the system. For \u03c9_{0}=0, the system reaches a synchronized stationary state at long times, characterized by a time-independent nonzero value of the synchronization order parameter that quantifies macroscopic order in the system. Moreover, we find that resetting even an infinitesimal fraction of the total number of oscillators, in the extreme limit of infinite resetting rate, has the drastic effect of synchronizing the entire system, even in parameter regimes in which the bare evolution does not support global synchrony. By contrast, for \u03c9_{0}\u22600, the dynamics allows at long times either a synchronized stationary state or an oscillatory synchronized state, with the latter characterized by an oscillatory behavior as a function of time of the order parameter, with a nonzero time-independent time average. Our results thus imply that the nonreset subsystem always gets synchronized at long times through the act of resetting of the reset subsystem. Our results, analytical using the Ott-Antonsen ansatz as well as those based on numerical simulations, are obtained for two representative oscillator frequency distributions, namely, a Lorentzian and a Gaussian. Given that it is easier to reset a fraction of the system constituents than the entire system, we discuss how subsystem resetting may be employed as an efficient mechanism to control attainment of global synchrony in the Kuramoto system.", "citations": 11}

To date, there have been two key experimental observations in support of this hypothesis: (i) neuronal avalanches with power law distribution of size and (ii) long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs) in the amplitude of neural oscillations. The case for how these maximize dynamic range of information processing and communication is still being made and because a significant substrate for information coding and transmission is neural synchrony it is of interest to link synchronization measures with those of criticality. We propose a framework for characterizing criticality in synchronization based on an analysis of the moment-to-moment fluctuations of phase synchrony in terms of the presence of LRTCs. This framework relies on an estimation of the rate of change of phase difference and a set of methods we have developed to detect LRTCs. We test this framework against two classical models of criticality (Ising and Kuramoto) and recently described variants of these models aimed to more closely represent human brain dynamics. From these simulations we determine the parameters at which these systems show evidence of LRTCs in phase synchronization. We demonstrate proof of principle by analysing pairs of human simultaneous EEG and EMG time series, suggesting that LRTCs of corticomuscular phase synchronization can be detected in the resting state and experimentally manipulated. The existence of LRTCs in fluctuations of phase synchronization suggests that these fluctuations are governed by non-local behavior, with all scales contributing to system behavior. This has important implications regarding the conditions under which one should expect to see LRTCs in phase synchronization. Specifically, brain resting states may exhibit LRTCs reflecting a state of readiness facilitating rapid task-dependent shifts toward and away from synchronous states that abolish LRTCs.", "citations": 54}

Over the past decade a great deal of progress has been made in analytical descriptions of the macroscopic dynamics of the Kuramoto model, facilitated by the discovery of Ott and Antonsen's dimensionality reduction method. However, the vast majority of these works relies on a critical assumption where the oscillators' natural frequencies are drawn from a Cauchy, or Lorentzian, distribution, which allows for a convenient closure of the evolution equations from the dimensionality reduction. In this paper we investigate the low-dimensional dynamics that emerge from a broader family of natural frequency distributions, in particular, a family of rational distribution functions. We show that, as the polynomials that characterize the frequency distribution increase in order, the low-dimensional evolution equations become more complicated, but nonetheless the system dynamics remain simple, displaying a transition from incoherence to partial synchronization at a critical coupling strength. Using the low-dimensional equations we analytically calculate the critical coupling strength corresponding to the onset of synchronization and investigate the scaling properties of the order parameter near the onset of synchronization. These results agree with calculations from Kuramoto's original self-consistency framework, but we emphasize that the low-dimensional equations approach used here allows for a true stability analysis categorizing the bifurcations.", "citations": 18}

In this paper, we develop a model for oscillators, which adapt both their phases and frequencies. It is found that this model naturally reproduces some observed phenomena that are not qualitatively produced by the standard Kuramoto model, such as long waiting times before the synchronization of clapping audiences. By assuming a self-consistent steady state solution, we find three stability regimes for the coupling constant k , separated by critical points k{1} and k{2}: (i) for k<k{1} only the stable incoherent state exists; (ii) for k>k{2}, the incoherent state becomes unstable and only the synchronized state exists; and (iii) for k{1}<k<k{2} both the incoherent and synchronized states are stable. In the bistable regime spontaneous transitions between the incoherent and synchronized states are observed for finite ensembles. These transitions are well described as a stochastic process on the order parameter r undergoing fluctuations due to the system's finite size, leading to the following conclusions: (a) in the bistable regime, the average waiting time of an incoherent-->coherent transition can be predicted by using Kramer's escape time formula and grows exponentially with the number of oscillators; (b) when the incoherent state is unstable (k>k{2}), the average waiting time grows logarithmically with the number of oscillators.", "citations": 50}

Specifically, he identified a critical value of the coupling strength, at which the incoherent state loses stability and a gradual build-up of coherence begins. Recently, Kuramoto's scenario was shown to hold for a large class of coupled systems on convergent families of deterministic and random graphs [Chiba and Medvedev, \"The mean field analysis of the Kuramoto model on graphs.

Guided by these results, in the present work, we study several model problems illustrating the link between network topology and synchronization in coupled dynamical systems. First, we identify several families of graphs, for which the transition to synchronization in the Kuramoto model starts at the same critical value of the coupling strength and proceeds in a similar manner. These examples include Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi random graphs, Paley graphs, complete bipartite graphs, and certain stochastic block graphs. These examples illustrate that some rather simple structural properties such as the volume of the graph may determine the onset of synchronization, while finer structural features may affect only higher order statistics of the transition to synchronization. Furthermore, we study the transition to synchronization in the Kuramoto model on power law and small-world random graphs. The former family of graphs endows the Kuramoto model with very good synchronizability: the synchronization threshold can be made arbitrarily low by varying the parameter of the power law degree distribution. For the Kuramoto model on small-world graphs, in addition to the transition to synchronization, we identify a new bifurcation leading to stable random twisted states.

Motivated by recent experimental observations, we here uncover an intriguing class of transitions in coupled oscillators, extreme synchronization transitions, from asynchronous disordered states to synchronous states with almost completely ordered phases. Whereas such a transition appears like discontinuous or explosive phase transitions, it exhibits markedly distinct features. First, the transition occurs already in finite systems of N units and so constitutes an intriguing bifurcation of multi-dimensional systems rather than a genuine phase transition that emerges in the thermodynamic limit N \u2192 \u221e only. Second, the synchronization order parameter jumps from moderate values of the order of N\u22121/2 to values extremely close to 1, its theoretical maximum, immediately upon crossing a critical coupling strength. We analytically explain the mechanisms underlying such extreme transitions in coupled complexified Kuramoto oscillators. Extreme transitions may similarly occur across other systems of coupled oscillators as well as in certain percolation processes. In applications, their occurrence impacts our ability of ensuring or preventing strong forms of ordering, for instance in biological and engineered systems. Sudden order-disorder transitions can be seen in the variety of biological and engineered systems.

Each oscillator is imbued with its own personal inherent driving frequency and experiences attractive coupling forces toward all the other oscillators in the system. As the coupling increases, there exists a minimal coupling strength called the critical coupling beyond which the system moves in a collective rhythm. A unified approach for creating approximations of the critical coupling is created. It is based on an interpretation of a measurement of phase synchronization among the oscillators (the order parameter) as a function of the coupling strength. The approach allows a graphical way to develop new approximations that are provably, strict lower bounds. It is shown that several of the critical coupling bounds that have been previously studied can be interpreted in this unified framework. In addition, a process based on fixed point sampling is introduced that converts upper bounds for the critical coupling into associated lower bounds.", "citations": 1}

This paper presents a mathematically rigorous, data-driven synchronization framework for calibrating effective sampling timing in TI-ADCs based on the Kuramoto oscillator model. Conventional clock-alignment methods often fail to capture signal-path mismatches, such as sampling switch aperture delay, while correlation-based techniques suffer from signal-dependent \u201cblind-spot\u201d regions. Overcoming this fundamental limitation without analog complexity is achieved via a fully digital feedback loop where each sub-ADC channel is modeled as a coupled oscillator following discrete-time Kuramoto dynamics. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on auxiliary analog phase detectors, the proposed scheme utilizes the ADC outputs to estimate and correct the effective sampling instants directly. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis proves that global phase synchronization is guaranteed when the adaptive coupling strength exceeds a critical value Kc. Theoretical results show that the system ensures exponential convergence of phase alignment, driving the total inter-channel timing error toward zero without relying on input-signal statistics. Behavioral MATLAB R2025a simulations of a 12-bit, 4-channel, 10 GS/s TI ADC confirm the analytical predictions. The proposed Kuramoto-based calibration achieves a residual skew reduction of over 99% and an SFDR improvement of 55.12 dB compared to correlation-based methods, even at blind-spot input frequencies, while adaptively reducing digital control power through dynamic coupling adjustment. The study demonstrates that data-driven, synchronization-based calibration provides an input-independent, energy-efficient, and mathematically verifiable solution for system-level timing correction in TI ADCs.", "citations": 0}

When dynamics undergo in a network, one can also consider dynamical communities, i.e., a group of nodes displaying a similar dynamical process. We have investigated both analytically and numerically the development of a dynamical community structure, where the community is referred to as a group of nodes synchronized in frequency, in networks of phase oscillators. We first demonstrate that using a few example networks, the community structure changes when network connectivity or interaction strength is varied. In particular, we found that community switching, i.e., a portion of oscillators change the group to which they synchronize, occurs for a range of parameters. We then propose a three-oscillator model: a bidirectional, weighted chain of three Kuramoto phase oscillators, as a theoretical framework for understanding the community formation and its variation. Our analysis demonstrates that the model shows a variety of partially synchronized patterns: oscillators with similar natural frequencies tend to synchronize for weak coupling, while tightly connected oscillators tend to synchronize for strong coupling. We obtain approximate expressions for the critical coupling strengths by employing a perturbative approach in a weak coupling regime and a geometric approach in strong coupling regimes. Moreover, we elucidate the bifurcation types of transitions between different patterns. Our theory might be useful for understanding the development of partially synchronized patterns in a wider class of complex networks than community structured networks.", "citations": 0}

Stable complex locked states indicate a locked subpopulation of zero mean frequency in the real-variable model and their imaginary parts help identifying which units comprise that subpopulation.

These transitions have been accurately characterized thanks to a self-consistent mean-field approach joined with extensive numerical simulations. The higher-order interactions favour the formation of two cluster states, which emerge from the incoherent regime via continuous (discontinouos) transitions for unimodal (bimodal) distributions. Fully synchronized initial states give rise to two symmetric equally populated bimodal clusters, each characterized by either positive or negative natural frequencies. These bimodal clusters are formed at an angular distance $\\gamma$, which increases for decreasing pair-wise couplings until it reaches $\\gamma=\\pi$ (corresponding to an anti-phase configuration), where the cluster state destabilizes via an abrupt transition: the $\\pi$-transition. The uniform clusters that reform immediately after (with a smaller angle $\\gamma$) are composed by oscillators with positive and negative $\\{ \\omega_i \\}$.

The critical coupling strength for the instability of incoherence is rigorously derived to be zero by carrying out a linear stability analysis of an incoherent state. For positive values of the coupling strength, at which the incoherence turns out to be unstable, a self-consistency approach is developed to theoretically predict the degree of global coherence of the model. Our theoretical analyses match well with numerical simulations, which helps us to deepen the understanding of collective behaviors spontaneously emerged in heterogeneously coupled high-dimensional dynamical networks.", "citations": 6}

In contrast with earlier results on similar systems with normalized coupling, we have indications that for the decay exponent less than the dimensions of the lattice and for large populations, synchronization is possible even if the coupling is arbitarily weak.

In case the coupling strength is strong, a sufficient condition of synchronization is established for general $N\\geqslant 2$. On the other hand, we analyze the case when the coupling strength is weak. For $N=2$, when coupling strength is weak (below the critical coupling strength $\\lambda_c$), we show that new periodic orbits emerge near each equilibrium point, and hence phase-locking state exists. This phenomenon is different from the real Kuramoto system since it is impossible to arrive at any synchronization when $\\lambda<\\lambda_c$. We prove a theorem that states a set of closed and dense contour forms near each equilibrium point, resembling a tree's growth rings. In other words, the trajectory of phase difference lies on a $4D$-torus surface. Therefore, this implies that the phase-locking state is Lyapunov stable but not asymptotically stable. The proof uses a new infinite buffer method (``$\\delta/n$ criterion\") and a Lyapunov function argument. This has been studied both analytically and numerically. For $N=3$, we consider the ``Lion Dance flow\", the analog of Cherry flow for our model, to demonstrate that the quaternionic synchronization exists even when the coupling strength is ``super weak\"(when $\\lambda/\\omega<0.85218915...$).

Here we explore the effects of correlating the disorder. Specifically, we assume that any given oscillator either attracts or repels all the others, and that the sign of the interaction is deterministically correlated with the given oscillator's natural frequency. For symmetrically correlated disorder with zero mean, we find that the system spontaneously synchronizes, once the width of the frequency distribution falls below a critical value. For asymmetrically correlated disorder, the model displays coherent traveling waves: the complex order parameter becomes nonzero and rotates with constant frequency different from the system's mean natural frequency.

When the population is described by a native frequency distribution that is reflection-symmetric about zero, the problem has circular symmetry. In the limit of zero extrinsic noise, although the critical eigenvalues are embedded in the continuous spectrum, the nonlinear coefficients in the amplitude equation remain finite, in contrast to the singular behavior found in similar instabilities described by the Vlasov-Poisson equation. For a bimodal reflection-symmetric distribution, both types of bifurcation are possible and they coincide at a codimension-two Takens-Bogdanov point. The steady-state bifurcation may be supercritical or subcritical and produces a time-independent synchronized state. The Hopf bifurcation produces both supercritical stable standing waves and supercritical unstable traveling waves. Previous work on the Hopf bifurcation in a bimodal population by Bonilla, Neu, and Spigler and by Okuda and Kuramoto predicted stable traveling waves and stable standing waves, respectively.

MOCU is especially useful for optimal experimental design (OED) as the potential efficacy of an experimental (or data acquisition) campaign can be quantified by estimating the MOCU that is expected to remain after the campaign.

However, analysis focused on individual orbits seems hard to extend to complex systems, while a global statistical approach is overly cursory. Koopman operator technique seems to balance well the two approaches. In this paper we extend Koopman analysis to the study of synchronization of coupled oscillators by extracting important eigenvalues and eigenfunctions from the observed time series. A renormalization group analysis is designed to derive an analytic approximation of the eigenfunction in the case of weak coupling that dominates the oscillation. For moderate or strong couplings, numerical computation further confirms the importance of the average frequencies and the associated eigenfunctions. The synchronization transition points could be located with quite high accuracy by checking the correlation of neighboring eigenfunctions at different coupling strengths, which is readily applied to other nonlinear systems.", "citations": 5}

Several frameworks have been proposed to induce explosive synchronization in a network and it has been reported that phase frustration in a network usually suppresses first order transition in the presence of pairwise interactions among the oscillators. However, on the contrary, by considering networks of phase frustrated coupled oscillators in the presence of higher-order interactions (up to 2-simplexes) we show here, under certain conditions, phase frustration can promote explosive synchronization in a network. A low-dimensional model of the network in the thermodynamic limit is derived using the Ott-Antonsen ansatz to explain this surprising result.

Such coarse-graining procedures often require extensive experience and/or a deep understanding of the system dynamics. In this paper we present a systematic, data-driven approach to discovering \u201cbespoke\u201d coarse variables based on manifold learning algorithms. We illustrate this methodology with the classic Kuramoto phase oscillator model, and demonstrate how our manifold learning technique can successfully identify a coarse variable that is one-to-one with the established Kuramoto order parameter. We then introduce an extension of our coarse-graining methodology which enables us to learn evolution equations for the discovered coarse variables via an artificial neural network architecture templated on numerical time integrators (initial value solvers). This approach allows us to learn accurate approximations of time derivatives of state variables from sparse flow data, and hence discover useful approximate differential equation descriptions of their dynamic behavior. We demonstrate this capability by learning ODEs that agree with the known analytical expression for the Kuramoto order parameter dynamics at the continuum limit. We then show how this approach can also be used to learn the dynamics of coarse variables discovered through our manifold learning methodology. In both of these examples, we compare the results of our neural network based method to typical finite differences complemented with geometric harmonics. Finally, we present a series of computational examples illustrating how a variation of our manifold learning methodology can be used to discover sets of \u201ceffective\u201d parameters, reduced parameter combinations, for multi-parameter models with complex coupling. We conclude with a discussion of possible extensions of this approach, including the possibility of obtaining data-driven effective partial differential equations for coarse-grained neuronal network behavior, as illustrated by the synchronization dynamics of Hodgkin\u2013Huxley type neurons with a Chung-Lu network. Thus, we build an integrated suite of tools for obtaining data-driven coarse variables, data-driven effective parameters, and data-driven coarse-grained equations from detailed observations of networks of oscillators.", "citations": 26}

The overall operational state of these systems therefore crucially depends on the correct and reliable functioning of the individual elements as well as the information they transmit through the network.

We construct W for any N in terms of a known superpotential w for a single-scalar model, such as that for the sine-Gordon equation or the \u03d5 4 model, leading to an expression for V which has multiple minima that supports solitons. Static solitons which minimize the total energy in each soliton sector appear as solutions of first-order Bogomolny equations, which have a gradient structure. These are identical in form to equations which arise in the context of synchronization phenomena in complex systems, with the space and time variables interchanged. The sine-Gordon superpotential, for example, leads to an explicit periodic superpotential W for N scalar fields, with associated Bogomolny equations that are equivalent to the well-known Kuramoto equations which describe the synchronization of identical phase oscillators on the unit circle. The known asymptotic properties of the Kuramoto system, for both positive and negative coupling constants, ensure that finite-energy solitons exist for any given set of intermediate values imposed at the origin.

We study how network modifications affect the synchronization properties of network-coupled dynamical systems that have heterogeneous node dynamics (e.g., phase oscillators with non-identical frequencies), which is often the case for real-world systems. Our approach relies on a synchrony alignment function (SAF) that quantifies the interplay between heterogeneity of the network and of the oscillators and provides an objective measure for a system's ability to synchronize. We conduct a spectral perturbation analysis of the SAF for structural network modifications including the addition and removal of edges, which subsequently ranks the edges according to their importance to synchronization. Based on this analysis, we develop gradient-descent algorithms to efficiently solve optimization problems that aim to maximize phase synchronization via network modifications. We support these and other results with numerical experiments.", "citations": 22}

We prove upper and lower bounds on the measure of the set of frequencies that exhibit phase locking in terms of a weighted sum of spanning trees in the oscillator network.

We propose a theoretical classification method for five types of bifurcation diagrams including the new ones, paying attention to the generality of the theory.

In this setting, the ensemble of generalized Kuramoto oscillators loses its synchronization even when the coupling strength is large. This leads to the study of a concept of \"relaxed\" synchronization, which is called \"practical synchronization\" in literature. In this new concept of \"weak\" synchronization, the phase diameter of the entire ensemble is uniformly bounded by some constant inversely proportional to the coupling strength. We focus on the complete synchronizability of a subensemble consisting of generalized Kuramoto oscillators with the same intrinsic dynamics; moreover, we provide several sufficient frameworks leading to local exponential synchronization of each homogeneous subensemble, although the whole ensemble is not fully synchronized.

The model was recently extended by reinterpreting the oscillators as particles moving on the surface of unit spheres in a D-dimensional space. Each particle is then represented by a D-dimensional unit vector; for D=2 the particles move on the unit circle and the vectors can be described by a single phase, recovering the original Kuramoto model. This multidimensional description can be further extended by promoting the coupling constant between the particles to a matrix K that acts on the unit vectors. As the coupling matrix changes the direction of the vectors, it can be interpreted as a generalized frustration that tends to hinder synchronization. In a recent paper we studied in detail the role of the coupling matrix for D=2. Here we extend this analysis to arbitrary dimensions. We show that, for identical particles, when the natural frequencies are set to zero, the system converges either to a stationary synchronized state, given by one of the real eigenvectors of K, or to an effective two-dimensional rotation, defined by one of the complex eigenvectors of K. The stability of these states depends on the set eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the coupling matrix, which controls the asymptotic behavior of the system, and therefore, can be used to manipulate these states. When the natural frequencies are not zero, synchronization depends on whether D is even or odd. In even dimensions the transition to synchronization is continuous and rotating states are replaced by active states, where the module of the order parameter oscillates while it rotates. If D is odd the phase transition is discontinuous and active states can be suppressed for some distributions of natural frequencies.", "citations": 12}

It is well-understood that, in the usual mean-field scaling, full phase-locking is unlikely and that it is partially phase-locked states that are important in applications. Despite this, while there has been much attention given to existence and stability of fully phase-locked states in the finite N Kuramoto model, the partially phase-locked states have received much less attention. In this paper we present two related results. Firstly, we derive an analytical criteria that, for sufficiently strong coupling, guarantees the existence of a partially phase-locked state by proving the existence of an attracting ball around a fixed point of a subset of the oscillators. We also derive a larger invariant ball such that any point in it will asymptotically converge to the attracting ball. Secondly, we consider the large N behavior of the finite N Kuramoto system with randomly distributed frequencies. In the case where the frequencies are independent and identically distributed we use a result of De Smet and Aeyels on partial entrainment to derive a condition giving (with high probability) the existence of a partially entrained cluster. We also derive upper and lower bounds on the size of the largest entrained cluster, together with a lower bound on the order parameter. Interestingly in a series of numerical experiments we find that the observed size of the largest entrained cluster is predicted extremely well by the upper bound.", "citations": 3}

Characterizing the structure of these basins is, in general, a complicated task, especially in high dimensionality. Recent works have advocated to quantify the non-linear stability of fixed points of dynamical systems through the relative volumes of the associated basins of attraction [Wiley et al., Chaos 16, 015103 (2006) and Menck et al. Nat. Phys. 9, 89 (2013)]. Here, we revisit this issue and propose an efficient numerical method to estimate these volumes. The algorithm first identifies stable fixed points. Second, a set of initial conditions is considered that are randomly distributed at the surface of hypercubes centered on each fixed point. These initial conditions are dynamically evolved. The linear size of each basin of attraction is finally determined by the proportion of initial conditions which converge back to the fixed point. Armed with this algorithm, we revisit the problem considered by Wiley et al. in a seminal paper [Chaos 16, 015103 (2006)] that inspired the title of the present manuscript and consider the equal-frequency Kuramoto model on a cycle. Fixed points of this model are characterized by an integer winding number q and the number n of oscillators. We find that the basin volumes scale as (1-4q/n)n, contrasting with the Gaussian behavior postulated in the study by Wiley et al..

Neuroscience research in this area has much to gain from understanding the Kuramoto model, a mathematical model that speaks to the very nature of coupled oscillating processes, and which has elucidated the core mechanisms of a range of biological and physical phenomena. In this paper, we provide a brief introduction to the Kuramoto model in its original, rather abstract, form and then focus on modifications that increase its neurobiological plausibility by incorporating topological properties of local cortical connectivity. The extended model elicits elaborate spatial patterns of synchronous oscillations that exhibit persistent dynamical instabilities reminiscent of cortical activity. We review how the Kuramoto model may be recast from an ordinary differential equation to a population level description using the nonlinear Fokker\u2013Planck equation. We argue that such formulations are able to provide a mechanistic and unifying explanation of oscillatory phenomena in the human cortex, such as fluctuating beta oscillations, and their relationship to basic computational processes including multistability, criticality, and information capacity.", "citations": 482}

In particular, we present a class of hybrid coupling rules depending only on local information to ensure uniform global practical or asymptotic synchronization, which is impossible to obtain by using the Kuramoto model customarily used in the literature. We further show that the synchronization set can be made uniformly globally prescribed finite-time stable by selecting the coupling function to be discontinuous at the origin. Novel mathematical tools on non-pathological functions and set-valued Lie derivatives are developed to carry out the stability analysis. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated in simulations where we apply our synchronizing hybrid coupling rules to models of power grids previously used in the literature.", "citations": 5}

Due to divergence in correlation measure at the transition point, the order parameter becomes a homogeneous function of all the relevent parameters.

For this purpose, we define the utility function which expresses the QoS of a user and synchronize this utility function value of each user for fair resource allocation. The synchronization of the utility function is obtained by Kuramoto model and coupling coefficient defined in Kuramoto model is dynamically adjusted for faster convergence. The range of convergence of the Kuramoto model is derived analytically.

In many instances, however, the synchronization is undesired because it may lead to system malfunctioning, as in the case of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, for example. Recent studies of static networks of oscillators have shown that the presence of a small fraction of so-called contrarian oscillators can suppress the undesired network synchronization. On the other hand, it is also known that the mobility of the oscillators can significantly impact their synchronization dynamics. Here, we combine these two ideas-the oscillator mobility and the presence of heterogeneous interactions-and study numerically binary mixtures of phase oscillators performing two-dimensional random walks. Within the framework of a generalized Kuramoto model, we introduce two phase-coupling schemes. The first one is invariant when the types of any two oscillators are swapped, while the second model is not. We demonstrate that the symmetric model does not allow for a complete suppression of the synchronized state. However, it provides means for a robust control of the synchronization timescale by varying the overall number density and the composition of the mixture and the strength of the off-diagonal Kuramoto coupling constant. Instead, the asymmetric model predicts that the coherent state can be eliminated within a subpopulation of normal oscillators and evoked within a subpopulation of the contrarians.", "citations": 0}

Kuramoto introduced a mathematical model of weakly coupled oscillators that gave a formal framework to some of the works of A.T. Winfree on biological clocks [Kuramoto (1975), Kuramoto (1984), Winfree (1980)]. The model proposes the idea that several oscillators can interact in a way such that the individual oscillation properties change in order to achieve a global behavior for the interconnected system. The Kuramoto model serves as a good representation of many systems in several contexts: biology, engineering, physics, mechanics, etc. [Ermentrout (1985), York (1993), Strogatz (1994), Dussopt et al. (1999), Strogatz (2000), Jadbabaie et a. (2003), Rogge et al. (2004), Marshall et al. (2004), Moshtagh et al. (2005)]. Recently, many works on the control community have focused on the analysis of the Kuramoto model, specially the one with sinusoidal coupling. The consensus or collective synchronization of the individuals is particularly important in many applications representing coordination, cooperation, emerging behavior, etc. Local stability properties of the consensus have been initially explored in [Jadbabaie et al. (2004)]. It must be noted that little attention has been devoted to the influence of the underlying interconnection graph on the stability properties of the system. The reason could be the fact that the local stability does not depend on the interconnection [van Hemmen et al. (1993)]. Global or almost global dynamical properties were studied in [Monzon et al. (2005), Monzon (2006), Monzon et al. (2006)]. In these works, the relevance of the interconnection graph of the system was hinted. In the present chapter, we go deeper on the analysis of the relationships between the dynamical properties of the system and the algebraic properties of the interconnection graph, exploiting the strong algebraic structure that every graph has. We step forward into a classification of the interconnection graphs that ensure almost global attraction of the set of synchronized states. In Section 2 we present the Kuramoto model for sinusoidally coupled oscillators, its general properties and the notion of almost global synchronization; in Section 3 we review some basic facts on algebraic graph theory; the symmetric Kuramoto model and the block analysis are presented in Sections 4 and 5; Section 6 gives some examples and applications of the main results; Section 7 presents the problem of classification of almost global synchronizing topologies.", "citations": 33}

Analytic results yield that if the repulsion parameter is small enough in comparison with the degree of the maximum hub, then the full synchronization state is locally stable. Numerical experiments are performed to explore the model beyond this threshold, where the overall cohesion is lost. We report in detail partially synchronous dynamical regimes, like stationary phase-locking, multistability, periodic and chaotic states.

Since information can be processed by collective spiking dynamics of neurons, the fine control of spiking dynamics is desirable for neuromorphic devices. Here we show that photonic spiking neurons implemented with paired nonlinear optical oscillators can be controlled to generate two modes of bio-realistic spiking dynamics by changing optical-pump amplitude. When the photonic neurons are coupled in a network, the interaction between them induces an effective change in the pump amplitude depending on the order parameter that characterizes synchronization. The experimental results show that the effective change causes spontaneous modification of the spiking modes and firing rates of clustered neurons, and such collective dynamics can be utilized to realize efficient heuristics for solving NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems.

Moreover, we show that all the stability information regarding the complete incoherence can be successfully retrieved from the reduced system via high-dimensional Ott-Antonsen ansatz for the D-dimensional generalized Kuramoto model.

A particularly interesting social phenomenon is our ability and tendency to fall into synchrony with other humans3,4. Our ability to coordinate actions and goals relies on the ability to distinguish between and integrate self and other, which when impaired can lead to devastating consequences. Interpersonal synchronization has been a widely used framework for studying action coordination and self-other integration, showing that in simple interactions, such as joint finger tapping, complex interpersonal dynamics emerge. Here we propose a computational model of self-other integration via within- and between-person action-perception links, implemented as a simple Kuramoto model with four oscillators. The model abstracts each member of a dyad as a unit consisting of two connected oscillators, representing intrinsic processes of perception and action. By fitting this model to data from two separate experiments we show that interpersonal synchronization strategies rely on the relationship between within- and between-unit coupling. Specifically, mutual adaptation exhibits a higher between-unit coupling than within-unit coupling; leading-following requires that the follower unit has a low within-unit coupling; and leading-leading occurs when two units jointly exhibit a low between-unit coupling. These findings are consistent with the theory of interpersonal synchronization emerging through self-other integration mediated by processes of action-perception coupling4. Hence, our results show that chaotic human behaviour occurring on a millisecond scale can be modelled using coupled oscillators.", "citations": 80}

Consequently, the stable equilibrium of the corresponding homogeneous Kuramoto model is unique and the basin of attraction for the synchronous state of these coupled oscillators is the whole phase space minus a set of measure zero. In addition, our results address when the Burer-Monteiro method recovers the ground truth exactly from highly incomplete observations in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ synchronization and shed light on the robustness of nonconvex optimization algorithms against certain types of so-called monotone adversaries. Numerical simulations are performed to illustrate our results.", "citations": 69}

Though accurate mathematical models have been developed for describing the microscopic activity of single neurons and of their synapsis [2], it is convenient to use relatively simple systems [3], under the assumption that they could be able to reproduce the relevant collective phenomena exhibited by realistic systems. \n \nIn this perspective, in Ref. [4] we numerically studied a network composed of leaky integrate and fire neurons [5], a class of simple single neuron models that exhibit a periodic spiking behavior in the absence of synaptic coupling. The coupling is the result of pulses that are sent across the system. The natural heterogeneity in the network is represented by the fact that different neurons have different spiking frequencies. Moreover we consider a delay between the pulse emission and its arrival. \n \nThe main result here discussed, and reported in Ref. [4], is that, upon increasing the coupling strength of the neurons, such a kind of network exhibits a transition to a nontrivial collective dynamics. \n \nRelevant differences divide our findings from the transition observed in the Kuramoto model (KM) [6], a paradigmatic model for synchronization phenomena, describing the dynamics of an ensemble of coupled phase oscillators. \n \nFirst, the model that we considered is not chaotic and it eventually converges to a periodic orbit. Moreover the transient time needed to approach some periodic orbit grows exponentially with the number of neurons. Thus implying that for large population of neurons the relevant dynamical regime is the \u201ctransient\u201c, rather than the periodic orbit approached over astronomical time scales! This is an instance of \u201cstable chaos\u201d [7-9]. \n \nBut the most striking difference with KM concerns the dynamical regime observed beyond the transition, in fact in this case the overall neural activity is not constant and not even simply periodically modulated, but exhibits irregular, seemingly chaotic, oscillations. \n \nThe mechanism here analyzed may contribute to the irregular background activity observed in the cerebral cortex.", "citations": 0}

The modification is such that the coupling depends on the fraction of synchronized oscillators, a situation which has been noted in some experiments on coupled Josephson junctions and mechanical systems. We let the global coupling k be a function of the Kuramoto order parameter r through an exponent z such that z=1 corresponds to the standard Winfree model, z<1 strengthens the coupling at low r (low amount of synchronization), and at z>1 , the coupling is weakened for low r . Using both analytical and numerical approaches, we find that z controls the size of the incoherent phase region and that one may make the incoherent behavior less typical by choosing z<1 . We also find that the original Winfree model is a rather special case; indeed, the partial locked behavior disappears for z>1 . At fixed k and varying gamma , the stability boundary of the locked phase corresponds to a transition that is continuous for z<1 and first order for z>1 . This change in the nature of the transition is in accordance with a previous study of a similarly modified Kuramoto model.", "citations": 30}

Besides coupling strengths, time-delays due to transmissions via tracts are crucial features of a connectome. They represent a proxy of the spatial structure (the tract lengths) to the temporal dynamics. Thus, the most straightforward approach to model brain dynamics in space and time is to concatenate oscillatory nodes to a connectome-based network. \n \nThe analysis that we performed on the experimentally derived connectome suggests that the tract lengths - distances between different brain nodes, thus the time delays, follow a multimodal distribution. \n \nHere, we investigated the conceptual implementation of multimodal distributions of discrete time delays of network links, and its effects on the mean-field dynamics. Because of the analytical tractability, the Kuramoto oscillator describes the temporal dynamics of each node, and the links between the nodes are symmetric but heterogeneous. Hence, we analyze synchronization in populations of phase oscillators [2], which have the same distribution of natural frequencies and coupling strengths, but their structure is defined solely by their different intra- and inter-population delays. \n \nAssuming a same overall distribution of time delays, several cases are investigated: from fully random distribution, to two delays-imposed structures of subpopulations, Figure \u200bFigure11. \n \n \n \nFigure 1 \n \nSchematic representation of the delay-imposed structure of population of oscillators: with different inter and same intra delays in A; same inter and intra delays in B; and random distribution of the delays, in C. \n \n \n \nFor all scenarios, mean-field dynamics are analytically obtained [3] and numerically confirmed. Moreover, boundaries and stabilities of different low-dimensional solutions are also investigated. These reveal a split of phase dynamics in different clusters, which can be phase shifted, or even non-stationary with different time-varying frequencies of synchronization and order parameters for the clusters. \n \nIn summary, the large-scale spatial organization of the brain is integrated in a network model. Using this model, we present the effects of the multimodal distribution of time delays and the structure that they impose on the network dynamics such as synchronization. Hence, we stress the role of the spatial organization of the brain that is reflected through the different time-delays between different parts of the brain in the formation of spatiotemporal dynamics.", "citations": 6}

To see a response of the system to the random inputs, we provide propagation of regularity, local-in-time stability estimates for the variations of the random kinetic density function in random parameter space.

Specifically, we derive estimates on the rate of convergence to the global equilibrium for solutions of the Kuramoto-Sakaguchi equation in a large coupling strength regime from generic initial data. As a by-product, using the stability of the equation in the Wasserstein distance, we quantify the rate at which discrete Kuramoto oscillators concentrate around the global equilibrium. In doing this, we achieve a quantitative estimate in which the probability that the oscillators will concentrate at the given rate tends to one as the number of oscillators increases. Among the essential steps in our proof are: 1) An entropy production estimate inspired by the formal Riemannian structure of the space of probability measures, first introduced by F. Otto in [35]; 2) A new quantitative estimate on the instability of equilibria with antipodal oscillators based on the dynamics of norms of the solution in sets evolving by the continuity equation; 3) The use of generalized local logarithmic Sobolev and Talagrand type inequalities, similar to the ones derived by F. Otto and C. Villani in [36]; 4) The study of a system of coupled differential inequalities, by a treatment inspired by the work of L. Desvillettes and C. Villani [13]. Since the Kuramoto-Sakaguchi equation is not a gradient flow with respect to the Wasserstein distance, we derive such inequalities under a suitable fibered transportation distance.", "citations": 14}
