It is generally believed that homogeneity among the entities is beneficial for synchronization. This work shows theoretically, numerically, and experimentally that the opposite is not only possible but also common in systems with interaction delays. In such systems, heterogeneity among the entities is shown to promote synchronization, even when the heterogeneity is completely random. This finding advances our understanding of the interplay between order and disorder in the collective behavior of complex systems. We suggest that the phenomenon can be observed for diverse coupling schemes and has implications for real-world systems, where heterogeneity and delays are common and often unavoidable. A widely held assumption on network dynamics is that similar components are more likely to exhibit similar behavior than dissimilar ones and that generic differences among them are necessarily detrimental to synchronization. Here, we show that this assumption does not generally hold in oscillator networks when communication delays are present. We demonstrate, in particular, that random parameter heterogeneity among oscillators can consistently rescue the system from losing synchrony. This finding is supported by electrochemical-oscillator experiments performed on a multielectrode array network. Remarkably, at intermediate levels of heterogeneity, random mismatches are more effective in promoting synchronization than parameter assignments specifically designed to facilitate identical synchronization. Our results suggest that, rather than being eliminated or ignored, intrinsic disorder in technological and biological systems can be harnessed to help maintain coherence required for function.", "citations": 43}

However, its constructive role in stabilizing nontrivial cooperative patterns remains largely unexplored. In this Letter, we show that frequency heterogeneity among oscillators can induce stable cyclops and cluster states in Kuramoto networks with higher-mode coupling, even though these states are unstable in the identical oscillator case. Cyclops states, introduced in [Munyaev et\u00a0al., Phys. Rev.

Surprisingly, heterogeneity alone is sufficient to stabilize these patterns across a sizable range of detuning values without needing to be compensated by other forms of disorder or external tuning. To explain this effect, we introduce a mesoscopic collective coordinate approach that links microscopic frequency structure with mean-field cluster-level stability. Importantly, we demonstrate that the same disorder-induced stabilization mechanism also arises robustly in biologically and physically grounded networks of Winfree and Stuart-Landau oscillators, pointing to its generality and opening directions for designing multistate dynamics in heterogeneous networks.", "citations": 0}

Here, we focus on the effect of the ubiquitous neuronal heterogeneity on the synchronization of PING (pyramidal-interneuronal network gamma) and ING (interneuronal network gamma) rhythms. The synchronization properties of rhythms depends on the response of their collective phase to external input. We therefore determined the macroscopic phase-response curve for finite-amplitude perturbations (fmPRC), using numerical simulation of all-to-all coupled networks of integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons exhibiting either PING or ING rhythms. We show that the intrinsic neuronal heterogeneity can qualitatively modify the fmPRC. While the phase-response curve for the individual IF-neurons is strictly positive (type I), the fmPRC can be biphasic and exhibit both signs (type II). Thus, for PING rhythms, an external excitation to the excitatory cells can, in fact, delay the collective oscillation of the network, even though the same excitation would lead to an advance when applied to uncoupled neurons. This paradoxical delay arises when the external excitation modifies the internal dynamics of the network by causing additional spikes of inhibitory neurons, whose delaying within-network inhibition outweighs the immediate advance caused by the external excitation. These results explain how intrinsic heterogeneity allows the PING rhythm to become synchronized with a periodic forcing or another PING rhythm for a wider range in the mismatch of their frequencies. We demonstrate a similar mechanism for the synchronization of ING rhythms. Our results identify a potential function of neuronal heterogeneity in the synchronization of coupled \u03b3-rhythms, which may play a role in neural information transfer via communication through coherence. Author Summary The interaction of a large number of oscillating units can lead to the emergence of a collective, macroscopic oscillation in which many units oscillate in near-unison or near-synchrony. This has been exploited technologically, e.g., to combine many coherently interacting, individual lasers to form a single powerful laser. Collective oscillations are also important in biology. For instance, the circadian rhythm of animals is controlled by the near-synchronous dynamics of a large number of individually oscillating cells. In animals and humans brain rhythms reflect the coherent dynamics of a large number of neurons and are surmised to play an important role in the communication between different brain areas. To be functionally relevant, these rhythms have to respond to external inputs and have to be able to synchronize with each other. We show that the ubiquitous heterogeneity in the properties of the individual neurons in a network can contribute to that ability. It can allow the external inputs to modify the internal network dynamics such that the network can follow these inputs over a wider range of frequencies. Paradoxically, while an external perturbation may delay individual neurons, their ensuing within-network interaction can overcompensate this delay, leading to an overall advance of the rhythm.", "citations": 5}

Here, we address this problem by presenting a generalization of the master stability formalism that can be applied to heterogeneous oscillators with large mismatches. Our approach is based on the simultaneous block diagonalization of the matrix terms in the variational equation, and it leads to dimension reduction that simplifies the original equation significantly. This new formalism allows the systematic investigation of scenarios in which the oscillators need to be nonidentical in order to reach an identical state, where all oscillators are completely synchronized. In the case of networks of identically coupled oscillators, this corresponds to breaking the symmetry of the system as a means to preserve the symmetry of the dynamical state\u2014 a recently discovered effect termed asymmetry-induced synchronization (AISync).

We test the theory against experimental results and circuit-level simulations in a prototype system of mutually delay-coupled electronic clocks, so-called phase-locked loops. Interestingly, our results show that heterogeneity in the system can actually enhance the stability of synchronized states. That means that beyond the optimizations that can be achieved by tuning homogeneous coupling strengths, time delays, and loop-filter cut-off frequencies, heterogeneities in these system parameters enable much better optimization of perturbation decay rates, stabilization of synchronous states, and tuning of phase differences between the clocks. Our theory enables the design of custom-fit synchronization layers according to the specific requirements and properties of electronic systems, such as operational frequencies, phase relations, and, e.g., transmission delays.

Physiological heterogeneity can destabilize both coupling-induced and shared input-induced synchronization [1]. In the classical models of synchronization, collective state of a system of coupled oscillators is determined by outcome of rivalry between synchronizing effect of connections and desynchronizing effect of inhomogeneity [2]. Yet there are examples of the systems in which inhomogeneity enhances synchrony [3,4]. In this study we have developed a general framework for the correlation of coupled neuronal oscillators with a given phase sensitivity and we have shown that in some cases, for identical neurons, synchronized state is an unstable attractor and arbitrarily weak noise can destroy synchrony. Inhomogeneity in such systems could stabilize synchrony by providing an asymmetric basin of attraction around the stable phase-locked state. This in turn results in a sharper PDF for the time difference between spikes of the two neurons in presence of noise (see Figure \u200bFigure1A).1A). The analytic results are obtained by solving Fokker-Planck equations for phase oscillators and it is also shown that in presence of stochastic inputs, the most probable phase difference between spike times of the two neurons does not coincide with the stable point of the deterministic equations. Numerical tests on LIF neurons confirm the positive role of inhomogeneity in stabilizing synchrony and increasing correlation of spike trains. The only difference is that for the model neurons with biologically realistic phase response curve (PRC), the time difference between the spikes of two neurons in the stable state increases with inhomogeneity, in the case of LIF neurons, they lock in almost zero phase lag for sufficiently small values of inhomogeneity (see Figure \u200bFigure1B1B). \n \n \n \nFigure 1 \n \n(A) PDF for the phase difference of two type1 phase oscillators in the presence of noise for three levels of frequency mismatch.

These models link microscopic dynamics with low-dimensional systems of so-called firing rate equations that exactly capture the collective dynamics of large populations of heterogeneous quadratic integrate-and-fire (QIF) neurons. A particularly tractable type of heterogeneity is the distribution of the QIF neurons' excitability parameters, or inputs, according to a Lorentzian. While other distributions -- such as those approximating Gaussian or uniform distributions -- admit to exact mean-field reductions, they result in more complex firing rate equations that are challenging to analyze, and it remains unclear whether they produce comparable collective dynamics. Here, we first demonstrate why Lorentzian heterogeneity is analytically favorable and, second, identify when it leads to qualitatively different collective dynamics compared to other types of heterogeneity. A stationary mean-field approach enables us to derive explicit expressions for the distributions of the neurons' firing rates and voltages in macroscopic stationary states with arbitrary heterogeneities. We also explicate the exclusive relationship between Lorentzian distributed inputs and Lorentzian distributed voltages, whose width happens to coincide with the population firing rate. A dynamic mean-field approach for unimodal heterogeneities further allows us to comprehensively analyze and compare collective dynamics.

Furthermore, the dynamics and the power spectrum in the stronger feedback regime show frequency and phase-locking as the amount of misalignment disorder increases.", "citations": 3}

This includes scenarios in which interacting entities are required to be non-identical in order to exhibit identical behaviour, such as in reaching consensus. Here we present an experimental demonstration of this phenomenon. Using a network of alternating-current electromechanical oscillators, we show that their ability to achieve identical frequency synchronization is enhanced when the oscillators are tuned to be suitably non-identical and that converse symmetry breaking persists for a range of noise levels.

Here, we introduce a class of remarkably simple oscillator networks that concurrently exhibit all of these phenomena. The dynamical units consist of pairs of nonidentical phase oscillators, which we refer to as Janus oscillators by analogy with Janus particles and the mythological figure from which their name is derived. In contrast to previous studies, these networks exhibit (i) explosive synchronization with identical oscillators; (ii) extreme multistability of chimera states, including traveling, intermittent, and bouncing chimeras; and (iii) asymmetry-induced synchronization in which synchronization is promoted by random oscillator heterogeneity. These networks also exhibit the previously unobserved possibility of inverted synchronization transitions, in which a transition to a more synchronous state is induced by a reduction rather than an increase in the coupling strength. These various phenomena are shown to emerge under rather parsimonious conditions, and even in locally connected ring topologies, which has the potential to facilitate their use to control and manipulate synchronization in experiments.", "citations": 17}

We show that, for a given degree distribution, the maximum synchronizability is achieved when the network of couplings is weighted and directed and the overall cost involved in the couplings is minimum.

Explosive percolation, which was discovered in 2009, corresponds to an abrupt change in the network\u2019s structure, and explosive synchronization (which is concerned, instead, with the abrupt emergence of a collective state in the networks\u2019 dynamics) was studied as early as the first models of globally coupled phase oscillators were taken into consideration.

It is still not known, however, how neural heterogeneity can affect cortical computations, or impact the dynamics of typical cortical circuits constituted of sparse excitatory and inhibitory networks. In this work, we analytically and numerically study the dynamics of a typical cortical circuit with a certain level of neural heterogeneity. Our circuit includes realistic features found in real cortical populations, such as network sparseness, excitatory, and inhibitory subpopulations of neurons, and different cell-to-cell heterogeneities for each type of population in the system. We find highly differentiated roles for heterogeneity, depending on the subpopulation in which it is found. In particular, while heterogeneity among excitatory neurons non-linearly increases the mean firing rate and linearizes the f-I curves, heterogeneity among inhibitory neurons may decrease the network activity level and induces divisive gain effects in the f-I curves of the excitatory cells, providing an effective gain control mechanism to influence information flow. In addition, we compute the conditions for stability of the network activity, finding that the synchronization onset is robust to inhibitory heterogeneity, but it shifts to lower input levels for higher excitatory heterogeneity. Finally, we provide an extension of recently reported heterogeneity-induced mechanisms for signal detection under rate coding, and we explore the validity of our findings when multiple sources of heterogeneity are present.

However, in many spatially distributed networks, such as the mammalian circadian system, the noise that different oscillators experience can be effectively uncorrelated. Here, we show that uncorrelated noise can in fact enhance synchronization when the oscillators are coupled. Strikingly, our analysis also shows that uncorrelated noise can be more effective than common noise in enhancing synchronization. We first establish these results theoretically for phase and phase-amplitude oscillators subject to either or both additive and multiplicative noise. We then confirm the predictions through experiments on coupled electrochemical oscillators.

Previous studies extensively investigate noise-induced synchrony in coupled neural oscillators, with a focus on scenarios featuring uniform noise and equal coupling strengths between neurons. However, real-world or experimental settings frequently exhibit heterogeneity, including deviations from uniformity in coupling and noise patterns. This study investigates noise-induced synchrony in a pair of coupled excitable neurons operating in a heterogeneous environment, where both noise intensity and coupling strength can vary independently. Each neuron is an excitable oscillator, represented by the normal form of Hopf bifurcation (HB). In the absence of stimulus, these neurons remain quiescent but can be triggered by perturbations, such as noise. Typically, noise and coupling exert opposing influences on neural dynamics, with noise diminishing coherence and coupling promoting synchrony. Our results illustrate the ability of asymmetric noise to induce synchronization in such coupled neural oscillators, with synchronization becoming increasingly pronounced as the system approaches the excitation threshold (i.e., HB). Additionally, we find that uneven coupling strengths and noise asymmetries are factors that can promote in-phase synchrony. Notably, we identify an optimal synchronization state when the absolute difference in coupling strengths is maximized, regardless of the specific coupling strengths chosen. Furthermore, we establish a robust relationship between coupling asymmetry and the noise intensity required to maximize synchronization. Specifically, when one oscillator (receiver neuron) receives a strong input from the other oscillator (source neuron) and the source neuron receives significantly weaker or no input from the receiver neuron, synchrony is maximized when the noise applied to the receiver neuron is much weaker than that applied to the source neuron. These findings reveal the significant connection between uneven coupling and asymmetric noise in coupled neuronal oscillators, shedding light on the enhanced propensity for in-phase synchronization in two-neuron motifs with one-way connections compared to those with two-way connections.

Three cases are under consideration: forced synchronization of a single FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillator subject to periodic forcing, mutual synchronization of two coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators and ensembles of locally and globally coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons. It is demonstrated that L\u00e9vy noise provides for transformation of the forced synchronization area such that synchronization can arise or be destroyed through varying the L\u00e9vy noise parameters at fixed frequency and amplitude of the external force. Moreover, the L\u00e9vy noise can induce the counterintuitive transformation of the synchronization areas such that increasing the external force amplitude gives rise to leaving the synchronization area. In the context of synchronization of coupled oscillators, L\u00e9vy noise is also shown to control the transition to synchronization which can be achieved at lower or higher values of the coupling strength when changing the L\u00e9vy noise parameters.

For symmetrically correlated disorder with zero mean, we find that the system spontaneously synchronizes, once the width of the frequency distribution falls below a critical value.

Putting theory into practice, however, faces certain obstacles, particularly in radio technologies that cannot implement pulses but use common messages for interactions between nodes. This raises the question of how to deal with interference between messages. We show that interference can disturb the synchronization process and propose low-complex, randomization-based techniques to address this issue. First, we demonstrate that randomly switching between two transmit power levels (without increasing the average power) can expedite synchronization. The high-power transmissions temporarily boost network connectivity with negligible impact on the average interference. Second, we reduce interference by blindly distributing the messages over the entire oscillator cycle. Instead of using a fixed oscillator phase at which the pulses are sent, each node chooses its own, randomly selected phase to send a synchronization message. This node-specific \u201cfire phase\u201d is contained in the message to permit others to compute the timing. Third, we suggest that such interference management can also be beneficial for other synchronization techniques and validate this claim using Glossy as an example.

A parameter drift at any instant in one or multiple network nodes can destroy synchrony, causing failure and even collapse in the network performance. We introduced [Phys. Rev. E 95, 062204(2017)] a recovery strategy by selective addition of cross-coupling links to save synchrony in the network from the edge of failure due to parameter mismatch (small or large) in any nodes. This concept is extended to 2-layered multiplex networks when the emergent synchrony becomes resilient against a small or large parameter drifting. In addition, the stability of the synchronous state is enhanced from local stability to global stability of synchrony. By the addition of cross-coupling, the network revives complete synchrony in all the nodes except the perturbed nodes, which emerges into a type of generalized synchrony with all the unperturbed nodes. The generalized synchrony is manifested simply by a linear amplitude response in the state variable(s) of the perturbed node(s) by a scaling factor proportional to the mismatch. A set of systematic rules has been derived from the linear flow matrix of the dynamical system representing the nodes\u2019 dynamics that helps find the connectivity matrix of the cross-coupling links. Lyapunov function stability condition is used to determine the cross-coupling link strength that, in turn, establishes global stability of synchrony of the multiplex network. We verify the efficacy of our proposed coupling scheme with analytical results and numerical simulations of two examples of multiplex networks. In the first example, we use nonlocal connectivity in each layer with nodal dynamics of the FitzHugh-Nagumo neuron model. Furthermore, we use a second example of a two-layered multiplex network of chaotic R\u00f6ssler systems with random connectivity in both layers. We confirm that our results are generic, independent of nodes\u2019 dynamics and network topology.", "citations": 3}

In principle collective stochastic coherence and synchronizability are incompatible phenomena, since strongly synchronized elements behave identically and thus their response to noise is indistinguishable to that of a single element. Therefore one can expect systems that synchronize well to have a poor collective response to noise. Here we show that, in spite of this apparent conflict, a certain coupling architecture is able to reconcile the two properties. Specifically, our results reveal that weighted scale-free networks of diffusively coupled excitable elements exhibit both high synchronizability of their subthreshold dynamics and a good collective response to noise of their pulsed dynamics. This is established by comparing the behavior of this system to that of random, regular, and unweighted scale-free networks. We attribute the optimal response of weighted scale-free networks to a balance between degree heterogeneity, which ensures a good collective response to noise, and the coupling-strength weighting procedure, which overcomes the paradox of heterogeneity that would otherwise impair synchronization.", "citations": 14}

We show that the emergence of synchronization induces a structural asymmetry in the 2-MCI network such that the synapses onto the high frequency firing neurons are potentiated, while those onto the low frequency firing neurons are de-potentiated, resulting in the directed flow of information from low frequency firing neurons to high frequency firing neurons.

We show that this phenomenon is fundamentally stochastic and collective in nature. Indeed, for noise and coupling within specific ranges, an asymmetry in the transition rates between a resting and an excited regime progressively builds up, leading to an increase in the fraction of excited neurons eventually triggering a chain reaction associated with a macroscopic synchronized excursion and a collective return to rest where this process starts afresh, thus yielding the observed periodic synchronized oscillations. We further uncover a novel anti-resonance phenomenon: noise-induced synchronized oscillations disappear when the system is driven by periodic stimulation with frequency within a specific range. In that anti-resonance regime, the system is optimal for measures of information capacity. This observation provides a new hypothesis accounting for the efficiency of Deep Brain Stimulation therapies in Parkinson's disease, a neurodegenerative disease characterized by an increased synchronization of brain motor circuits. We further discuss the universality of these phenomena in the class of stochastic networks of excitable elements with confining coupling, and illustrate this universality by analyzing various classical models of neuronal networks.

Such systems model certain networks of oscillatory neurons where the neuronal dynamics, synaptic weights, and network structure interact with and shape each other. We model synaptic weight adaptation with spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) that runs on a longer time scale than neuronal spiking. Structural changes that include addition and elimination of contacts occur at yet a longer time scale than the weight adaptations. First, we study the steady-state dynamics of Kuramoto networks that are bistable and can settle in synchronized or desynchronized states. To compare the impact of adding structural plasticity, we contrast the network with only STDP to one with a combination of STDP and structural plasticity. We show that the inclusion of structural plasticity optimizes the synchronized state of a network by allowing for synchronization with fewer links than a network with STDP alone. With non-identical units in the network, the addition of structural plasticity leads to the emergence of correlations between the oscillators\u2019 natural frequencies and node degrees. In the desynchronized regime, the structural plasticity decreases the number of contacts, leading to a sparse network. In this way, adding structural plasticity strengthens both synchronized and desynchronized states of a network.

We leverage this modelization to embrace the in\ufb02uence of heterogeneous higher-order coupling, including promoting and inhibiting effects, on the signal response for two conventional models, the globally coupled overdamped bistable oscillators and excitable FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons. Particularly, we numerically and analytically reveal that the optimal signal response can be obtained by an intermediate degree of higher-order coupling diversity for both systems. This resonant signal response stems from the competition between dispersion and aggregation induced by heterogeneous higher-order and positive pairwise couplings, respectively. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the signal propagation in linearly coupled systems.", "citations": 0}

This may involve several brain regions interacting together by sharing information birectionally via rhythmic activity. Such flexibility requires the functional connectivity between the areas to be dynamic, and a key question is the relevant parameter and operating regimes that make this possible in spite of fixed structural connectivity. Working towards this goal, we consider two coupled brain regions, each of which exhibits a noisy rhythm, a commonly observed type of neural activity. Such rhythms can be induced by the stochasticity in the neural circuitry, or be autonomously generated through nonlinearities and not necessitating noise. For these two types of rhythms, we computed the amount of information shared between the brain areas and the preferred direction(s) of sharing. We found that without the coupling delay, the flexibility needed by the brain to perform cognitive tasks requires the rhythms to be autogenerated rather than noise-induced. This is the case even with asymmetry or heterogeneity. This suggests that the importance of the dynamical regime has to be taken into account when modeling interacting neural rhythms from an information theoretical point of view. Abstract Brain areas must be able to interact and share information in a time-varying, dynamic manner on a fast timescale. Such flexibility in information sharing has been linked to the synchronization of rhythm phases between areas. One definition of flexibility is the number of local maxima in the delayed mutual information curve between two connected areas. However, the precise relationship between phase synchronization and information sharing is not clear, nor is the flexibility in the face of the fixed structural connectivity and noise. Here, we consider two coupled oscillatory excitatory-inhibitory networks connected through zero-delay excitatory connections, each of which mimics a rhythmic brain area. We numerically compute phase-locking and delayed mutual information between the phases of excitatory local field potential (LFPs) of the two networks, which measures the shared information and its direction. The flexibility in information sharing is shown to depend on the dynamical origin of oscillations, and its properties in different regimes are found to persist in the presence of asymmetry in the connectivity as well as system heterogeneity. For coupled noise-induced rhythms (quasi-cycles), phase synchronization is robust even in the presence of asymmetry and heterogeneity. However, they do not show flexibility, in contrast to noise-perturbed rhythms (noisy limit cycles), which are shown here to exhibit two local information maxima, i.e., flexibility. For quasi-cycles, phase difference and information measures for the envelope-phase dynamics obtained from previous analytical work using the Stochastic Averaging Method (SAM) are found to be in good qualitative agreement with those obtained from the original dynamics. The relation between phase synchronization and communication patterns is not trivial, particularly in the noisy limit cycle regime. There, complex patterns of information sharing can be observed for a single value of the phase difference. The mechanisms reported here can be extended to I-I networks since their phase synchronizations are similar. Our results set the stage for investigating information sharing between several connected noisy rhythms in neural and other complex biological networks.", "citations": 4}

We formulate a general mean-field theory (Vlasov-Focker Planck equation) for stochastic Kuramoto-type phase oscillator models, valid for coupling graphs/networks with heterogeneous connectivity and coupling strengths, using graphop theory in the mean-field limit. Considering symmetric odd-valued coupling functions, we mathematically prove an exact formula for the critical threshold for the incoherence-coherence transition. We numerically test the predicted threshold using large finite-size representations of the network model. For a large class of graph models, we find that the numerical tests agree very well with the predicted threshold obtained from mean-field theory.

The influence of constant light on behavioral rhythms involves the regulation of collective neuronal behavior. The robustness of behavioral rhythms stems from the synchronization of neurons. In mammals, the synchronization among neurons is regulated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) located in the hypothalamus. Neurons within the SCN exhibit significant heterogeneity. The intrinsic frequency and coupling strength are two fundamental characteristics determining the internal dynamics of the SCN. In this study, the Poincar\u00e9 model was employed to investigate the impact of constant light on SCN neuronal dynamics. We found that constant light can modulate neuronal synchronization, a phenomenon tightly linked to the critical threshold value of coupling strength among the neurons. Specifically, under weak coupling, constant light enhances neuronal synchronization. Under strong coupling, constant light weakens synchronization among oscillators. Furthermore, higher light intensity results in lengthened periods and reduced amplitudes. Our findings elucidate important underlying mechanisms by which constant light either enhances or diminishes mammalian behavioral rhythms, and provide a new perspective for understanding the complex regulation network of circadian rhythms.", "citations": 3}

Such heterogeneity arises naturally in various settings, for example, as an approximation to transmission delays, excitatory-inhibitory interactions, or as amplitude and phase responses of oscillators with electrical or mechanical coupling. We find that breaking the phase-lag symmetry results in a variety of states with uniform and non-uniform synchronization, including in-phase and anti-phase synchrony, full incoherence (splay state), chimera states with phase separation of 0 or \u03c0 between populations, and states where both populations remain desynchronized. These desynchronized states exhibit stable, oscillatory, and even chaotic dynamics. Moreover, we identify the bifurcations through which chimeras emerge. Stable chimera states and desynchronized solutions, which do not arise for homogeneous phase-lag parameters, emerge as a result of competition between synchronized in-phase, anti-phase equilibria, and fully incoherent states when the phase-lags are near \u00b1\u03c02 (cosine coupling).

The PRC characterizes the effects of transient inputs on spike timing and can be measured experimentally. Here we use the adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire (aEIF) neuron model to determine how subthreshold and spike-triggered slow adaptation currents shape the PRC. Based on that, we predict how synchrony and phase locked states of coupled neurons change in presence of synaptic delays and unequal coupling strengths. We find that increased subthreshold adaptation currents cause a transition of the PRC from only phase advances to phase advances and delays in response to excitatory perturbations. Increased spike-triggered adaptation currents on the other hand predominantly skew the PRC to the right. Both adaptation induced changes of the PRC are modulated by spike frequency, being more prominent at lower frequencies. Applying phase reduction theory, we show that subthreshold adaptation stabilizes synchrony for pairs of coupled excitatory neurons, while spike-triggered adaptation causes locking with a small phase difference, as long as synaptic heterogeneities are negligible. For inhibitory pairs synchrony is stable and robust against conduction delays, and adaptation can mediate bistability of in-phase and anti-phase locking. We further demonstrate that stable synchrony and bistable in/anti-phase locking of pairs carry over to synchronization and clustering of larger networks. The effects of adaptation in aEIF neurons on PRCs and network dynamics qualitatively reflect those of biophysical adaptation currents in detailed Hodgkin-Huxley-based neurons, which underscores the utility of the aEIF model for investigating the dynamical behavior of networks. Our results suggest neuronal spike frequency adaptation as a mechanism synchronizing low frequency oscillations in local excitatory networks, but indicate that inhibition rather than excitation generates coherent rhythms at higher frequencies.", "citations": 53}

While there are numerous well-known order parameters to characterize these dynamics, shortcoming of these metrics are also recognized. To capture all transitions from phase disordered states over phase locking to fully synchronized systems, new metrics were proposed and demonstrated on homogeneous models. In this paper, we aim to address a gap in the literature, namely, to examine how the gradual improvement of power grid models affects the goodness of certain metrics. To study how the details of models are perceived by the different metrics, 12 variations of a power grid model were created, introducing varying levels of heterogeneity through the coupling strength, the nodal powers, and the moment of inertia. The grid models were compared using a second-order Kuramoto equation and adaptive Runge-Kutta solver, measuring the values of the phase, the frequency, and the universal order parameters. Finally, frequency results of the models were compared to grid measurements. We found that the universal order parameter was able to capture more details of the grid models, especially in cases of decreasing moment of inertia. Even the most heterogeneous models showed notable synchronization, encouraging the use of such models. Finally, we show local frequency results related to the multi-peaks of static models, which implies that spatial heterogeneity can also induce such multi-peak behavior.", "citations": 4}

We demonstrate that depending on relation between correction rate and phase coherence the oscillators may exhibit both continuous and discontinuous transition from incoherence to synchrony upon the change of interaction constant. To illustrate our analytical results, numerical simulations have been performed for a large population of phase oscillators with the proposed type of coupling.", "citations": 2}

The Kuramoto theory for the transition to synchronization can be explicitly generalized, such as the expression for the critical coupling strength. Also, a self-consistency approach is developed to predict the stationary states in the thermodynamic limit. Moreover, Landau damping effects are further revealed by means of linear stability analysis and resonance poles theory below the critical threshold, which turns to be far more generic.

Yet in realistic systems, parameter mismatch is unavoidable and even worse in some circumstances, the oscillators might follow different types of dynamics. Considering the significance of synchronization to the functioning of many realistic systems, it is natural to ask the following question: Can synchronization be achieved in networked oscillators of clearly different parameters or dynamics? Here, by the model of networked chaotic oscillators, we are able to demonstrate and argue that, despite the presence of parameter mismatch (or different dynamics), stable synchronization can still be achieved on symmetric complex networks. Specifically, we find that when the oscillators are configured on the network in such a way that the symmetric nodes have similar parameters (or follow the same type of dynamics), cluster synchronization can be generated. The stabilities of the cluster synchronization states are analyzed by the method of symmetry-based stability analysis, with the theoretical predictions in good agreement with the numerical results.

To address this question, we investigate a globally coupled network of Kuramoto-Sakaguchi oscillators that includes both pairwise (1-simplex) and higher-order (2-simplex) interactions, together with additive stochastic forcing. Systematic numerical simulations across a broad range of coupling strengths, phase-lag values, and noise intensities reveal that synchronization emerges through a nontrivial interplay among these parameters. In general, weak frustration combined with mutually reinforcing coupling promotes synchronization, whereas strong frustration favors coherence under repulsive coupling. Forward and backward parameter sweeps reveal the coexistence of synchronized and desynchronized states. The presence and width of this bistable region depend sensitively on phase frustration, noise intensity, and higher-order coupling strength, with higher-order interactions significantly widening the bistable interval. To explain these behaviors, we employ the Ott-Antonsen reduction to derive a low-dimensional amplitude equation that predicts the forward critical point in the thermodynamic limit, the backward saddle-node point, and the width of the bistable region. Higher order interactions widen this region by shifting the saddle-node point without affecting the forward critical point. Further analysis of Kramer's escape rate explains how noise destabilizes coexistence states and diminishes bistability. Overall, our results provide a unified theoretical and numerical framework for frustrated, noisy, higher-order oscillator networks, revealing that synchronization is strongly influenced by the combined action of phase frustration, stochasticity, and both pairwise and higher-order interactions.", "citations": 0}

Importantly, their functionality, i.e., whether these networks can perform their function or not, depends on the emerging collective dynamics of the network. Synchrony of oscillations is one of the most prominent examples of such collective behavior and has been associated both with function and dysfunction. Understanding how network structure and interactions, as well as the microscopic properties of individual units, shape the emerging collective dynamics is critical to find factors that lead to malfunction. However, many biological systems such as the brain consist of a large number of dynamical units. Hence, their analysis has either relied on simplified heuristic models on a coarse scale, or the analysis comes at a huge computational cost. Here we review recently introduced approaches, known as the Ott\u2013Antonsen and Watanabe\u2013Strogatz reductions, allowing one to simplify the analysis by bridging small and large scales. Thus, reduced model equations are obtained that exactly describe the collective dynamics for each subpopulation in the oscillator network via few collective variables only. The resulting equations are next-generation models: Rather than being heuristic, they exactly link microscopic and macroscopic descriptions and therefore accurately capture microscopic properties of the underlying system. At the same time, they are sufficiently simple to analyze without great computational effort. In the last decade, these reduction methods have become instrumental in understanding how network structure and interactions shape the collective dynamics and the emergence of synchrony. We review this progress based on concrete examples and outline possible limitations.

In this paper, we show that the Q-function approach also leads to a novel definition of \"synchronization\" for coupled stochastic oscillators. A system of coupled oscillators in the synchronous regime may be viewed as a single (higher-dimensional) oscillator. Therefore, we investigate the relation between the Q-functions of the uncoupled oscillators and the higher-dimensional Q-function for the coupled system.

Whereas such a transition appears like discontinuous or explosive phase transitions, it exhibits markedly distinct features. First, the transition occurs already in finite systems of N units and so constitutes an intriguing bifurcation of multi-dimensional systems rather than a genuine phase transition that emerges in the thermodynamic limit N \u2192 \u221e only. Second, the synchronization order parameter jumps from moderate values of the order of N\u22121/2 to values extremely close to 1, its theoretical maximum, immediately upon crossing a critical coupling strength. We analytically explain the mechanisms underlying such extreme transitions in coupled complexified Kuramoto oscillators. Extreme transitions may similarly occur across other systems of coupled oscillators as well as in certain percolation processes. In applications, their occurrence impacts our ability of ensuring or preventing strong forms of ordering, for instance in biological and engineered systems.

This is revealed by numerical explorations of a variety of oscillator systems: rings of generic phase oscillators and rings of paradigmatic limit-cycle oscillators, like Stuart-Landau and van der Pol.

Working on a generalization of the Kuramoto model that allows for odd or non-odd couplings, we elucidate synchronization of oscillator lattices as an instance of generic scale invariance, whereby the system displays space-time criticality, largely irrespective of parameter values. The critical properties of the system (like scaling exponent values and the dynamic scaling Ansatz which is satisfied) fall into universality classes of kinetically rough interfaces with columnar disorder, namely, those of the Edwards-Wilkinson (equivalently, the Larkin model of an elastic interface in a random medium) or the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equations, for Kuramoto (odd) coupling and generic (non-odd) couplings, respectively. From the point of view of kinetic roughening, the critical properties we find turn out to be quite innovative, especially concerning the statistics of the fluctuations as characterized by their probability distribution function (PDF) and covariance. While the latter happens to be that of the Larkin model irrespective of the symmetry of the coupling, in the generic non-odd coupling case the PDF turns out to be the Tracy-Widom distribution associated with the KPZ nonlinearity.

The results are summarized in two phase diagrams, for homogeneous and heterogeneous populations, which are obtained analytically to a large extent. For excitatory coupling, the phase diagram is remarkably similar to that of the Kuramoto model with time delays, although here the stability boundaries extend to regions in parameter space where the neurons are not self-sustained oscillators. In contrast, the structure of the boundaries for inhibitory coupling is different, and already for homogeneous networks unveils the presence of various partially synchronized states not present in the Kuramoto model: Collective chaos, quasiperiodic partial synchronization (QPS), and a novel state which we call modulated-QPS (M-QPS).

In addition, the adaptive network also exhibits partial synchronization patterns such as phase and frequency clusters, forced entrained, and incoherent states. We introduce two measures for the strength of incoherence based on the standard deviation of the temporally averaged (mean) frequency and on the mean frequency to classify the emergent dynamical states as well as their transitions. We provide a two-parameter phase diagram showing the wealth of dynamical states. We additionally deduce the stability condition for the frequency-entrained state.

Here we show distinct effects of heterogeneity and noise in a population of modified theta neurons randomly coupled via GABAergic synapses. By introducing the Fokker-Planck equation and circular cumulants, we derive a set of two-cumulant macroscopic equations. In bifurcation analyses, we find a stabilizing effect of heterogeneity and a nontrivial effect of noise that results in promoting, diminishing, and shifting the oscillatory region, and is largely dependent on the reversal potential of GABAergic synapses.

The model assumes that oscillators can synchronize their dynamics, using concepts inherited from the Kuramoto model, which effectively accounts for the discrete state effects observed in Buslaev nets. The governing equation for oscillator dynamics incorporates four key factors: deceleration caused by conflicts with neighboring oscillators and the synchronization process, which induces additional acceleration or deceleration.

Existing methods for inferring structural connections from observed dynamics, such as correlation-based or spectral techniques, may fail to fully capture complex relationships in high-dimensional time series in an interpretable way. Here, we propose the use of path signatures\u2013a mathematical framework that encodes geometric and temporal properties of continuous paths\u2013to address this problem. Path signatures provide a reparametrization-invariant characterization of dynamical data and, in particular, can be used to compute the lead matrix, which reveals lead-lag phenomena. We showcase our approach on time series from coupled oscillators in the Kuramoto model defined on a stochastic block model graph, termed the Kuramoto Stochastic Block Model (KSBM). Using mean-field theory and Gaussian approximations, we analytically derive reduced models of KSBM dynamics in different temporal regimes and theoretically characterize the lead matrix in these settings. Leveraging these insights, we propose a novel signature-based community detection algorithm, achieving exact recovery of structural communities from observed time series in multiple KSBM instances. We also explore the performance of our community detection on a stochastic variant of the KSBM as well as on real neuropixels of cortical recordings to demonstrate applicability on real-world data.

On the other hand, the oscillators behave collectively in frequency (phase velocity) even in three dimensions (d=3) , indicating that the lower critical dimension for frequency entrainment is dF(l)=2 . Nonlinear effects due to the periodic nature of limit-cycle oscillators are found to become significant in the weak-coupling regime: So-called runaway oscillators destroy the synchronized (ordered) phase and there emerges a fully random (disordered) phase.

Conversely, if the external current assumes very high values, then an opposite effect is observed, i.e., the prevention of the network synchronization. We explain such behaviors considering different mechanisms involved in the system, such as incoherence, minimization of currents, and stochastic effects from the Poissonian spikes. Furthermore, we present some numerical simulations where the stimulation of only a fraction of neurons, for instance, can induce phase synchronization in the non-stimulated fraction of the network, besides cases in which for larger coupling values, it is possible to propagate the spiking activity in the network when considering stimulation over only one neuron.", "citations": 2}

We use phenomenological model of delay-coupled oscillators with increasing degree of topological complexity to identify underlying principles by which the spatio-temporal structure of the brain governs the phase lags between oscillatory activity at distant regions. Phase relations and their regions of stability are derived and numerically confirmed for two oscillators and for networks with randomly distributed or clustered bimodal delays, as a first approximation for the brain structural connectivity. Besides in-phase, clustered delays can induce anti-phase synchronization for certain frequencies, while the sign of the lags is determined by the natural frequencies and by the inhomogeneous network interactions. For in-phase synchronization faster oscillators always phase lead, while stronger connected nodes lag behind the weaker during frequency depression, which consistently arises for in-silico results. If nodes are in anti-phase regime, then a distance \u03c0 is added to the in-phase trends. The statistics of the phases is calculated from the phase locking values (PLV), as in many empirical studies, and we scrutinize the method\u2019s impact. The choice of surrogates do not affects the mean of the observed phase lags, but higher significance levels that are generated by some surrogates, cause decreased variance and might fail to detect the generally weaker coherence of the interhemispheric links. These links are also affected by the non-stationary and intermittent synchronization, which causes multimodal phase lags that can be misleading if averaged.

By assuming a self-consistent steady state solution, we find three stability regimes for the coupling constant k , separated by critical points k{1} and k{2}: (i) for k<k{1} only the stable incoherent state exists; (ii) for k>k{2}, the incoherent state becomes unstable and only the synchronized state exists; and (iii) for k{1}<k<k{2} both the incoherent and synchronized states are stable. In the bistable regime spontaneous transitions between the incoherent and synchronized states are observed for finite ensembles. These transitions are well described as a stochastic process on the order parameter r undergoing fluctuations due to the system's finite size, leading to the following conclusions: (a) in the bistable regime, the average waiting time of an incoherent-->coherent transition can be predicted by using Kramer's escape time formula and grows exponentially with the number of oscillators; (b) when the incoherent state is unstable (k>k{2}), the average waiting time grows logarithmically with the number of oscillators.", "citations": 50}

This is as true as anywhere in the energy metabolism of individual cells. Exchanges of molecules and common regulation operate throughout the metabolic processes of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, making the consideration of each of these as a network a natural step. Oscillations are similarly ubiquitous within these processes, and the frequencies of these oscillations are never truly constant. These features make this system an ideal example with which to discuss an alternative approach to modeling living systems, which focuses on their thermodynamically open, oscillating, non-linear and non-autonomous nature. We implement this approach in developing a model of non-autonomous Kuramoto oscillators in two all-to-all weighted networks coupled to one another, and themselves driven by non-autonomous oscillators. Each component represents a metabolic process, the networks acting as the glycolytic and oxidative phosphorylative processes, and the drivers as glucose and oxygen supply. We analyse the effect of these features on the synchronization dynamics within the model, and present a comparison between this model, experimental data on the glycolysis of HeLa cells, and a comparatively mainstream model of this experiment. In the former, we find that the introduction of oscillator networks significantly increases the proportion of the model's parameter space that features some form of synchronization, indicating a greater ability of the processes to resist external perturbations, a crucial behavior in biological settings. For the latter, we analyse the oscillations of the experiment, finding a characteristic frequency of 0.01\u20130.02 Hz. We further demonstrate that an output of the model comparable to the measurements of the experiment oscillates in a manner similar to the measured data, achieving this with fewer parameters and greater flexibility than the comparable model.", "citations": 10}

For this purpose, we derive an expression for the change of the phase distribution entropy due to the stimulus. We relate this change to the properties of individual units characterized by generally different natural frequencies and phase response curves and the population's state. We verify the general result by analyzing a two-frequency population model and demonstrating a good agreement of the theory and numerical simulations.", "citations": 3}

We demonstrate the approach using experiments with electrochemical reactions on multielectrode arrays, in which we selectively assign ensemble subgroups into spatiotemporal patterns with multiple phase clusters. The experimentally confirmed mechanism elucidates the connection between the phases and natural frequencies of a collection of dynamical elements, the spatial and temporal information that is encoded within this ensemble, and how external signals can be used to retrieve this information.

It was widely known that the system experiences a continuous (second-order) phase transition to synchronization by gradually increasing the homogeneous coupling among the oscillators. As the interest in exploring synchronized dynamics continues to grow, the heterogeneous patterns between phase oscillators have received ample attention during the past years. Here, we consider a variant of the Kuramoto model with quenched disorder in their natural frequencies and coupling. Correlating these two types of heterogeneity via a generic weighted function, we systematically investigate the impacts of the heterogeneous strategies, the correlation function, and the natural frequency distribution on the emergent dynamics. Importantly, we develop an analytical treatment for capturing the essential dynamical properties of the equilibrium states. In particular, we uncover that the critical threshold corresponding to the onset of synchronization is unaffected by the location of the inhomogeneity, which, however, does depend crucially on the value of the correlation function at its center. Furthermore, we reveal that the relaxation dynamics of the incoherent state featuring the responses to external perturbations is significantly shaped by all the considered effects, thereby leading to various decaying mechanisms of the order parameters in the subcritical region. Moreover, we untangle that synchronization is facilitated by the out-coupling strategy in the supercritical region. Our study is a step forward in highlighting the potential importance of the inhomogeneous patterns involved in the complex systems, and could thus provide theoretical insights for profoundly understanding the generic statistical mechanical properties of the steady states toward synchronization.", "citations": 0}

Many studies have gained key insights into this question by studying the classic Kuramoto oscillator model on static networks. However, new questions arise when the network structure is time varying or when the oscillator system is multistable, the latter of which can occur when an inertial term is added to the Kuramoto model. While the consequences of evolving topology and multistability on collective behavior have been examined separately, real-world systems such as gene regulatory networks and the brain may exhibit these properties simultaneously. It is thus relevant to ask how time-varying network connectivity impacts synchronization in systems that can exhibit multistability. To address this question, we study how the dynamics of coupled Kuramoto oscillators with inertia are affected when the topology of the underlying network changes in time. We show that hysteretic synchronization behavior in networks of coupled inertial oscillators can be driven by changes in connection topology alone. Moreover, we find that certain fixed-density rewiring schemes induce significant changes to the level of global synchrony that remain even after the network returns to its initial configuration, and we show that these changes are robust to a wide range of network perturbations. Our findings highlight that the specific progression of network topology over time, in addition to its initial or final static structure, can play a considerable role in modulating the collective behavior of systems evolving on complex networks.", "citations": 5}

We investigated the individual and collective activity patterns of two Leptothorax ant species. We show that in one species (Leptothorax sp. W), ants converge onto rhythmic cycles of synchronized collective activity with a period of about 20 min. A second species (Leptothorax crassipilis) exhibits more complex collective dynamics, where dominant collective cycle periods range from 16 min to 2.8 h. Recordings that last 35 h reveal that, in both species, the same colony can exhibit multiple oscillation frequencies. We observe that workers of both species can be stimulated by nest-mates to become active after a refractory resting period, but the durations of refractory periods differ between the species and can be highly variable. We model the emergence of synchronized rhythms using an agent-based model informed by our empirical data.

In previous works without iSTDP, fast sparsely synchronized rhythms, associated with diverse cognitive functions, were found to appear in a range of large noise intensities for fixed strong synaptic inhibition strengths. Here, we investigate the effect of iSTDP on fast sparse synchronization (FSS) by varying the noise intensity D. We employ an asymmetric anti-Hebbian time window for the iSTDP update rule [which is in contrast to the Hebbian time window for the excitatory STDP (eSTDP)]. Depending on values of D, population-averaged values of saturated synaptic inhibition strengths are potentiated [long-term potentiation (LTP)] or depressed [long-term depression (LTD)] in comparison with the initial mean value, and dispersions from the mean values of LTP/LTD are much increased when compared with the initial dispersion, independently of D. In most cases of LTD where the effect of mean LTD is dominant in comparison with the effect of dispersion, good synchronization (with higher spiking measure) is found to get better via LTD, while bad synchronization (with lower spiking measure) is found to get worse via LTP. This kind of Matthew effect in inhibitory synaptic plasticity is in contrast to that in excitatory synaptic plasticity where good (bad) synchronization gets better (worse) via LTP (LTD). Emergences of LTD and LTP of synaptic inhibition strengths are intensively investigated via a microscopic method based on the distributions of time delays between the pre- and the post-synaptic spike times.

We discover a general approximate principle for predicting the onset of frequency synchronization from the spectral knowledge of a complex matrix representing a combination of the signless Laplacian induced by repulsive coupling and a matrix associated with intrinsic frequency detuning. We show that the gap between the two smallest eigenvalues of the complex matrix generally controls the coupling threshold for frequency synchronization. In stark contrast with Laplacian networks, we demonstrate that local rings and all-to-all networks prevent frequency synchronization, whereas full bipartite networks have optimal synchronization properties. Beyond laser models, we show that, with a few exceptions, the spectral principle can be applied to repulsive Kuramoto networks. Our results may provide guidelines for optimal designs of scalable laser networks capable of achieving reliable synchronization.", "citations": 0}

We hypothesize and identify a possible cause for the occurrence of such a synchronization, which is so far unknown: Pathological synchronization is caused not just because of the increase in the strength of coupling between the populations but also because of the strength of the strong synchronization of the drive population. We propose a demand controlled method to control this pathological synchronization by providing a delayed feedback where the strength and frequency of the synchronization determine the strength and the time delay of the feedback.

Instead of modeling circadian dynamics with generic oscillator models (e.g., Kuramoto-type), we use a detailed computational neuroscience model, which integrates biomolecular dynamics, neuronal electrophysiology, and network effects. This allows us to investigate the effect of small drug molecules, such as Longdaysin, and connect our results with experimental findings. To combat the high dimensionality of such a detailed model, we employ a matrix-free approach, while our entire algorithmic pipeline enables numerical continuation and construction of bifurcation diagrams using only direct simulation.

In this new regime, the system exhibits coherent subsystems of antiphase synchronized oscillators, which are stationary clusters following a spatiotemporal beating phenomena (ZZ regime). This regime is the result of a stronger coupling. We show from a phase mismatch model applied to each oscillator, that these phase coherent domains undergo a global phase instability, meanwhile the interactions between oscillators become nonlocal.

In this paper we study synchronization of phase oscillators on the most basic example of such a network, namely, the hierarchical lattice. Each site of the lattice carries an oscillator that is subject to noise. Pairs of oscillators interact with each other at a strength that depends on their hierarchical distance, modulated by a sequence of interaction parameters. We look at block averages of the oscillators on successive hierarchical scales, which we think of as block communities. In the limit as the number of oscillators per community tends to infinity, referred to as the hierarchical mean-field limit, we find a separation of time scales, i.e., each block community behaves like a single oscillator evolving on its own time scale. We argue that the evolution of the block communities is given by a renormalized mean-field noisy Kuramoto equation, with a synchronization level that depends on the hierarchical scale of the block community. We find three universality classes for the synchronization levels on successive hierarchical scales, characterized in terms of the sequence of interaction parameters. What makes our model specifically challenging is the non-linearity of the interaction between the oscillators. The main results of our paper therefore come in three parts: (I) a conjecture about the nature of the renormalisation transformation connecting successive hierarchical scales; (II) a truncation approximation that leads to a simplified renormalization transformation; (III) a rigorous analysis of the simplified renormalization transformation. We provide compelling arguments in support of (I) and (II), but a full verification remains an open problem.", "citations": 11}

The fundamental first step is to establish whether or to what extent the interactions between the units can be considered pairwise and, thus, can be modeled as an interaction network with simple links corresponding to pairwise interactions. In principle, this can be determined by comparing the maximum entropy given the bivariate probability distributions to the true joint entropy. In many practical cases, this is not an option since the bivariate distributions needed may not be reliably estimated or the optimization is too computationally expensive. Here we present an approach that allows one to use mutual informations as a proxy for the bivariate probability distributions. This has the advantage of being less computationally expensive and easier to estimate. We achieve this by introducing a novel entropy maximization scheme that is based on conditioning on entropies and mutual informations. This renders our approach typically superior to other methods based on linear approximations.

In this paper, we report on an experimental setup for the analysis of RS in networks of Stuart-Landau oscillators and in particular investigate the behavior of tree structures focusing on the path to synchronization, that is, on the analysis of how synchronization emerges as the coupling strength increases from zero. We find that RS occurs in a region wherein further increases of the coupling strength lead to a direct transition to global synchronization but may also be observed in a second region, corresponding to lower coupling values, wherein it first emerges and then disappears, hallmarking a scenario that we denote as fading of remote synchronization. We show that this result is related to the behavior of pairs of remotely synchronized nodes observed in networks with more general topologies.

Formal averaging and the calculus of variations are then applied to such reduced models in order to derive optimal subharmonic entrainment waveforms. The optimal entrainment of a canonical model for a spiking neuron is used to illustrate this approach, which is readily extended to arbitrary oscillating systems.", "citations": 0}

In a feedforward network of stochastic neural oscillators, we study the firing rate heterogeneity stemming from two sources: intrinsic (different individual cells) and network (different effects from presynaptic inputs). We find that the relationship between these two forms of heterogeneity can lead to significant changes in firing rate heterogeneity. We consider several networks, including noisy excitatory synaptic inputs, and noisy inputs with both excitatory and inhibitory inputs. To mathematically explain these results, we apply a phase reduction and derive asymptotic approximations of the firing rate statistics assuming weak noise and coupling.

To overcome this deficiency we propose an alternative model which approximates the van der Pol oscillator to finitely large nonlinearities while remaining numerically tractable. This allows us to uncover interesting phenomena in the deep-quantum strongly-nonlinear regime with no classical analog, such as the persistence of amplitude death on resonance. We also report nonlinearity-induced position correlations in reactively coupled quantum oscillators. Such coupled oscillations become more and more correlated with increasing nonlinearity before reaching some maximum. Again, this behavior is absent classically.

Motivated especially by coupling functions in biology, including the cardiorespiratory and neural delta-alpha coupling functions, this paper offers a contribution to the understanding of effects due to time-varying interactions. Through both numerics and mathematically rigorous theoretical consideration, we show that for time-variable coupling functions with time-independent net coupling strength, transitions into and out of phase- synchronization can occur, even though the frozen coupling functions determine phase-synchronization solely by virtue of their net coupling strength. Thus the information about interactions provided by the shape of coupling functions plays a greater role in determining behaviour when these coupling functions are time-variable.

Using mean-field theory and its dynamical approximation, we obtain a phase diagram for dense associative memory model that exhibits a tricritical point at which the continuous onset of memory retrieval is supplanted by a discontinuous, hysteretic transition. In the quartic-dominated regime, the system supports bistable phase-locked states corresponding to stored memory patterns, with a sizable energy barrier between memory and incoherent states. We analytically determine this bistable region and show that the escape time from a memory state (due to noise) grows exponentially with network size, indicating robust storage. Extending the theory to finite memory load, we show that higher-order couplings achieve superlinear scaling of memory capacity with system size, far exceeding the limit of pairwise-only oscillators. Large-scale simulations of the oscillator network confirm our theoretical predictions, demonstrating rapid pattern retrieval and robust storage of many phase patterns.

Consequently, a critical research question is how to develop effective pinning control methods capable to reduce or modulate synchronization as needed. Although such methods exist to control pairwise-coupled oscillators, and pinning control for synchronization has been developed in higher-order systems in recent years, there are no desynchronizing control methods for higher-order interactions, despite the increasing evidence of their relevant role in brain dynamics. In this work, we fill this gap by proposing a generalized control method designed to desynchronize Kuramoto oscillators connected through higher-order interactions. Our method embeds a higher-order Kuramoto model into a suitable Hamiltonian flow, and builds upon previous work in Hamiltonian control theory to analytically construct a feedback control mechanism. We numerically show that the proposed method effectively prevents synchronization in synthetic and empirical higher-order networks.

We find the appearance of extreme events in three different observables: average velocity, synchronization error, and one transverse directional variable to the synchronization manifold. The emergence of extreme events in average velocity variables happens due to the occasional in-phase synchronization. The on-off intermittency plays a crucial role in the genesis of extreme events in the synchronization error dynamics and in the transverse directional variable to the synchronization manifold. The bubble transition of the chaotic attractor due to the on-off intermittency is illustrated for the transverse directional variable. We use generalized extreme value theory to study the statistics of extremes. The extreme events data sets concerning the average velocity variable follow a generalized extreme value distribution.

The coupling effect results from the fact that the local concentration of the mediating chemical affects both its production and absorption by each oscillator.

We considered a mathematical model for this coupling, when the diffusion time is arbitrary with respect to the characteristic oscillator periods, yielding a system of coupled nonlinear integro-differential equations which can be solved using Green functions for appropriate boundary conditions. In this paper, we show numerical solutions of these equations for three finite domains: a linear one-dimensional interval, a rectangular, and a circular region, with absorbing boundary conditions.

Spectral coherence is a commonly used approach to quantify phase locking between neural signals. We systematically explored the validity of spectral coherence measures for quantifying synchronization among neural oscillators. To that aim, we simulated coupled oscillatory signals that exhibited synchronization dynamics using an abstract phase-oscillator model as well as interacting gamma-generating spiking neural networks. We found that, within a large parameter range, the spectral coherence measure deviated substantially from the expected phase-locking. Moreover, spectral coherence did not converge to the expected value with increasing signal-to-noise ratio. We found that spectral coherence particularly failed when oscillators were in the partially (intermittent) synchronized state, which we expect to be the most likely state for neural synchronization. The failure was due to the fast frequency and amplitude changes induced by synchronization forces. We then investigated whether spectral coherence reflected the information flow among networks measured by transfer entropy (TE) of spike trains. We found that spectral coherence failed to robustly reflect changes in synchrony-mediated information flow between neural networks in many instances. As an alternative approach we explored a phase-locking value (PLV) method based on the reconstruction of the instantaneous phase. As one approach for reconstructing instantaneous phase, we used the Hilbert Transform (HT) preceded by Singular Spectrum Decomposition (SSD) of the signal. PLV estimates have broad applicability as they do not rely on stationarity, and, unlike spectral coherence, they enable more accurate estimations of oscillatory synchronization across a wide range of different synchronization regimes, and better tracking of synchronization-mediated information flow among networks.", "citations": 128}

We discover an oscillator death state through a first-order (explosive) phase transition in which a single, coupling-dependent stable death state away from the origin exists in isolation without being accompanied by any other stable state usually existing for pairwise couplings. We call such a state a solitary death state. Contrary to widespread subcritical Hopf bifurcation, here we report homoclinic bifurcation as an origin of the explosive death state. Moreover, this explosive transition to the death state is preceded by a surge in amplitude and followed by a revival of the oscillations. The analytical value of the critical coupling strength for the solitary death state agrees with the simulation results.

These pulses, historically referred to as Trichel pulses, characterize the operation of a two-electrode system where the discharge electrode is subjected to a high negative DC voltage. The numerical algorithm indicates that in a multi-electrode discharge system, comprising multiple two-electrode discharges, each two-electrode system independently produces pulse trains. These systems, each comprising a pair of electrodes, operate in a pulsed mode, with synchronization emerging from weak yet significant interactions among them. These interactions arise from the mutual influence of electric fields and space charges generated by each discharge pair. This influence extends beyond individual systems, leading to a synchronization between both pairs, both in a pulsed mode. A three-species model of discharge was employed to simulate this process and it was based on the finite element method formulation. Two different numerical models were investigated, a 2D model, consisting of two discharge electrodes and a third grounded electrode, and two 1D-axisymmetric models, consisting dual and triple pairs of discharge systems. Experiments show a multi-stable nature of the coupled pulsed discharge systems, indicating that under appropriate conditions the pulse trains exhibit two distinct modes of synchronization: in-phase synchronization and anti-phase synchronization. The occurrence of each mode depends on factors such as interaction strength, applied voltage level, and various system parameters. Furthermore, variations in these factors can lead to additional outcomes, including out of phase synchronization, as well as scenarios involving near-harmonic oscillations and quenching.", "citations": 2}

Very often synchronization is observed in such populations if they are allowed to interact. A paradigmatic model for the study of such phenomena has been the Kuramoto model. However, considering real oscillations are rarely isochronous as a function of energy, it is natural to extend the model by allowing the natural frequencies to vary as a function of some dynamical resource supply. Beyond just accounting for a dynamical supply of resources, however, competition over a shared resource supply is important in a variety of biological systems. In neuronal systems, for example, resource competition enables the study of neural activity via fMRI. It is reasonable to expect that this dynamical resource allocation should have consequences for the synchronization behavior of the brain. This paper presents a modi\ufb01ed Kuramoto dynamics which includes additional dynamical terms that provide a relatively simple model of resource competition among populations of Kuramoto oscillators. We design a mutlilayer system which highlights the impact of the competition dynamics, and we show that in this designed system, correlations can arise between the synchronization states of two populations of oscillators which share no phase-coupling edges. These correlations are interesting in light of the often observed variance between functional and structural connectivity measures in real systems. The model presented here then suggests that some of the observed discrepancy may be explained by the way in which the brain dynamically allocates resources to di\ufb00erent regions according to demand. If true, models such as this one provide a theoretical framework for analyzing the di\ufb00erences between structural and functional measures, and possibly implicate dynamical resource allocation as an integral part of the neural computation process.", "citations": 0}

It is found that, by comparison with the constant coupling scenario, the presence of period coupling will suppress synchronization in general and, with a decrease in the frequency (or the increase of the amplitude) of the periodic coupling, the synchronization performance gradually deteriorates.

This concerns the effects of Zeitgebers, feedback loops and further modifying components. We start from a known mathematical oscillator model, which is based on experimental molecular findings.

In many instances, however, the synchronization is undesired because it may lead to system malfunctioning, as in the case of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, for example. Recent studies of static networks of oscillators have shown that the presence of a small fraction of so-called contrarian oscillators can suppress the undesired network synchronization. On the other hand, it is also known that the mobility of the oscillators can significantly impact their synchronization dynamics. Here, we combine these two ideas-the oscillator mobility and the presence of heterogeneous interactions-and study numerically binary mixtures of phase oscillators performing two-dimensional random walks. Within the framework of a generalized Kuramoto model, we introduce two phase-coupling schemes. The first one is invariant when the types of any two oscillators are swapped, while the second model is not. We demonstrate that the symmetric model does not allow for a complete suppression of the synchronized state. However, it provides means for a robust control of the synchronization timescale by varying the overall number density and the composition of the mixture and the strength of the off-diagonal Kuramoto coupling constant. Instead, the asymmetric model predicts that the coherent state can be eliminated within a subpopulation of normal oscillators and evoked within a subpopulation of the contrarians.", "citations": 0}

Here, it is assumed that the oscillators have diffusive single-variable coupling.

The motivation is the neuronal dynamics that takes place during information processing in the neural cortex. The neuron organization is modular, with clusters associated to different functions and brain structures, and need to constantly respond to external stimuli. We study the behavior of forced Kuramoto oscillators where only a fraction of them is subjected to a periodic external force. When all oscillators receive the external drive the system always synchronize with the periodic force if its intensity is sufficiently large. We show that the conditions for global synchronization depend on the fraction of nodes being forced and on network topology, strength of internal couplings and intensity of external forcing. We develop numerical and analytical calculations for the critical force for global synchronization as a function of the fraction of forced oscillators. As an application we study the response of the electric junction \\textit{C. elegans} network to external stimuli using the partially forced Kuramoto model. Stimuli were applied to topological modules, to ganglia, specified by their anatomical localization, and to the functional groups (sensory and motoneurons). We found that topological modules do not contain purely anamotical groups or functional classes, and that stimulating different classes of neurons lead to very different responses, measured in terms of synchronization and phase velocity correlations. In all cases the modular structure hindered full synchronization, protecting the system from seizures. The responses to stimuli applied to topological and functional modules showed pronounced patterns of correlation or anti-correlation with other modules that were not observed when the stimulus was applied to a ganglion with mixed functional neurons.", "citations": 1}

However, increasing evidence shows that interactions in real-world systems are not pairwise but higher-order, i.e., many-body.

Although MSF analysis has been used for 25 years to study the stability of synchronization states, a systematic investigation of MSF across various networked systems remains missing from the literature. In this article, we present a simplified and unified MSF analysis for diverse undirected and directed networked systems.

We substantiate our claims with experimental and numerical evidence of such synchronization solutions in a chain of three coupled semiconductor lasers with long interelement coupling delays. The generality of the mechanism is validated in a neuronal model with the same coupling architecture. Thus, our results show that zero-lag synchronized chaotic dynamical states can occur over long distances through relaying, without restriction by the amount of delay.", "citations": 271}

Using the standard framework of master-stability function (MSF), we investigate the emergence of complex synchronization behaviors under all possible configurations of two-channel coupling, which include, for example, all possible cross coupling schemes among the dynamical variables. Utilizing the classic R\u00f6ssler and Lorenz oscillators, we find a rich variety of synchronization phenomena not present in any previously extensively studied, single-channel coupling configurations. For example, in many cases two coupling channels can enhance or even generate synchronization where there is only weak or no synchronization under only one coupling channel, which has been verified in a coupled neuron system. There are also cases where the oscillators are originally synchronized under one coupling channel, but an additional synchronizable coupling channel can, however, destroy synchronization. Direct numerical simulations of actual synchronization dynamics verify the MSF-based predictions. Our extensive computation and heuristic analysis provide an atlas for synchronization of chaotic oscillators coupled through two channels, which can be used as a systematic reference to facilitate further research in this area.", "citations": 12}

We find that in both cases, particular oscillators undergo extremely fast and large amplitude excursions, resembling a rogue wave burst. Furthermore, the probability distribution of different amplitudes exhibits bimodality, with peaks at both vanishing and very large amplitude. While this phenomenology arises over a range of coupling strengths, for large values thereof the system eventually synchronizes and the above phenomenology is suppressed.

Because simple correlation measures are unable to characterize these collective patterns, we have developed more general methods for their detection and parametrization.

We find that, while too weak a coupling is not sufficient for the whole system to synchronize, too strong a coupling induces a nontrivial type of phase slip among oscillators, resulting in synchronization failure. Thus, an intermediate coupling range for synchronization exists, which becomes narrower when the network is more heterogeneous. Analyses of two noisy oscillators reveal that nontrivial phase slip is a generic phenomenon when noise is present and coupling is strong. Therefore, the low synchronizability of heterogeneous networks can be understood as a result of the difference in effective coupling strength among oscillators with different degrees; oscillators with high degrees tend to undergo phase slip while those with low degrees have weak coupling strengths that are insufficient for synchronization.", "citations": 2}

However, there is still a lack of specific models providing explanations of how 1/\u0192 noise is generated in coupled brain-body-environment systems, since existing models and experiments typically target either externally observable behaviour or isolated neuronal systems but do not address the interplay between neuronal mechanisms and sensorimotor dynamics. We present a conceptual model of a minimal neurorobotic agent solving a behavioural task that makes it possible to relate mechanistic (neurodynamic) and behavioural levels of description. The model consists of a simulated robot controlled by a network of Kuramoto oscillators with homeostatic plasticity and the ability to develop behavioural preferences mediated by sensorimotor patterns. With only three oscillators, this simple model displays self-organized criticality in the form of robust 1/\u0192 noise and a wide multifractal spectrum. We show that the emergence of self-organized criticality and 1/\u0192 noise in our model is the result of three simultaneous conditions: a) non-linear interaction dynamics capable of generating stable collective patterns, b) internal plastic mechanisms modulating the sensorimotor flows, and c) strong sensorimotor coupling with the environment that induces transient metastable neurodynamic regimes. We carry out a number of experiments to show that both synaptic plasticity and strong sensorimotor coupling play a necessary role, as constituents of self-organized criticality, in the generation of 1/\u0192 noise. The experiments also shown to be useful to test the robustness of 1/\u0192 scaling comparing the results of different techniques.

This model exhibits two types of oscillations with different characteristic time scales, namely, long and short time scales. Several types of phase synchronization are observed, such as 1:1 phase locking between a single spike and one period of the force and 1:l phase locking between the period of slow oscillation underlying bursts and l periods of the force. Moreover, spiking-bursting oscillations with chaotic firing patterns can be synchronized with the periodic force. Such a type of phase synchronization is detected from the position of a set of points on a unit circle, which is determined by the phase of the periodic force at each spiking time. We show that this detection method is effective for a system with multiple time scales. Owing to the existence of both the short and the long time scales, two characteristic phenomena are found around the transition point to chaotic phase synchronization. One phenomenon shows that the average time interval between successive phase slips exhibits a power-law scaling against the driving force strength and that the scaling exponent has an unsmooth dependence on the changes in the driving force strength. The other phenomenon shows that Kuramoto's order parameter before the transition exhibits stepwise behavior as a function of the driving force strength, contrary to the smooth transition in a model with a single time scale.", "citations": 17}

Large differences between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls were found in the cortical EEG signals.MethodsWe derive a phenomenological mathematical model, based on coupled phase oscillators with continuously distributed frequencies to describe the neural activity of the thalamo-cortical loop. We examine the influence of the bidirectional coupling strengths between the thalamic and the cortical area with regard to the phase-locking effects observed in the experiments. We extend this approach to a model consisting of a thalamic area coupled to two cortical areas, each comprising a set of nonidentical phase oscillators. In the investigations of our model, we applied the Ott-Antonsen theory and the Pikovsky-Rosenblum reduction methods to the original system.ResultsThe results derived from our mathematical model satisfactorily reproduce the experimental data obtained by EEG measurements. Furthermore, they show that modifying the coupling strength from the thalamic region to a cortical region affects the duration of phase synchronization, while a change in the feedback to the thalamus affects the strength of synchronization in the cortex. In addition, our model provides an explanation in terms of nonlinear dynamics as to why brain waves desynchronize after a given phase reset.ConclusionOur model can explain functional differences seen between EEG records of healthy subjects and schizophrenia patients on a system theoretic basis. Because of this and its predictive character, the model may be considered to pave the way towards an early and reliable clinical detection of schizophrenia that is dependent on the interconnections between the thalamic and cortical regions.
